  /*
   * Ensure `data-size` directly on typography doesn't affect `--ds-size-*` variables.
   *
   * BACKGROUND:
   * In Figma, typography doesn't use the size variable mode to set their size, but instead
   * use a size property. Thus, setting e.g. heading size doesn't change the concrete values
   * of `size.*` variables in Figma
   *
   * This is in contrast with the CSS code, which uses `data-size` with an expanded
   * set of sizes to control the typography size. By default this would also change the
   * concrete values of `--ds-size-*` variables. Thus, the same variables would result in
   * different values in Figma and in code.
   *
   * SOLUTION:
   * With the following code, we ensure that using `--ds-size-*` variables for spacing
   * on typography elements will always refer to the nearest parent `data-size` (or the
   * default), and not the `data-size` set on the typography element itself, which matches
   * how the variables work in Figma.

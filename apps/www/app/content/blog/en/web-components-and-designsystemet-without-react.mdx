Many have asked if Designsystemet will offer web components so that you can use the components without React. The answer is yes!
But not everything will be web components. Let us explain why, and what we plan:

## Standards are good for everyone

Since the beginning, the goal has been to use web standards as much as possible, so that Designsystemet can be used in both old and new solutions,
regardless of technology and framework. Many of the components actually already work in pure HTML. A good example is the button component:

```jsx
// React:
<Button variant="secondary">Click me</Button>

// HTML:
<button class="ds-button" data-variant="secondary">Click me</button>
```

In the HTML version, we use standard class names and data attributes.
Not only does this work in all frameworks and equally well on both the server and in browsers - it also works for all users!
Standard HTML has built-in support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies, without the need for additional customizations.

## Why not make everything as web components?

Web components are a relatively new standard that makes it possible to create your own HTML elements with encapsulated functionality and style using JavaScript.
Although it may seem tempting to create a web component out of everything, for example a custom button:

```html
<ds-button data-variant="secondary">Click me</ds-button>
```

...this would cause us to lose much of the built-in accessibility that regular HTML gives us for free.
In addition, we get worse performance, since we become dependent on JavaScript, and you as a developer can no longer use HTML documentation to understand the code.

In short: Many components simply do not need to - and should not - be web components.
Modern CSS with class names and data attributes, in many cases provides both better flexibility and better performance.

## Which components will become web components?

Components that currently use React to implement logic will be made available as web components.
For example, `<ds-field>` will connect form fields with `<label>` and error messages, and
`<ds-tabs>` will handle tab navigation and associated content.

Other components, such as `Popover` and `Dialog`, do not need to become web components, because the web standard already
offers `events` or the [`command` attributes (chrome.com)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/command-and-commandfor) (with associated [polyfill (github.com)](https://github.com/keithamus/invokers-polyfill)) that we can use to help with opening and closing, and positioning.

Regardless of the technical solution, all components will be based on pure HTML,
work across technologies, and have the same API:
You use class names to select components, and data attributes to control settings and behavior.

## Timeline and input!

The work to make Designsystemet available without React will start in January 2026.

We will continuously release experimental versions so you can quickly test and provide feedback.

If you have any input or thoughts, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share them with us - either on [GitHub](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet) or on [Slack](/slack).

We are happy that the work is finally underway, and are now looking for ongoing feedback.
In this blog post, we will go over the components that have been changed, and how you can test.

<Alert>
You can install all `@digdir/designsystemet-*` packages with version `0.0.0-fix-designsystemet-web-20260121152531`.

All prereleases will also be under the `test` tag on NPM.
</Alert>

## Test in existing application

We have updated the React package to use `@digdir/designsystemet-web` as the underlying framework-independent component library.
This means that some components that are currently implemented in React may be experienced differently since they now come from the web package.
Feel free to test these and provide feedback.

These are:
- Popover (controlled may have problems here)
- Dropdown
- Tooltip
- Dialog
- Pagination
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabs
- Field

## Test in other frameworks or pure HTML/JS

To test the package without React, you can install `@digdir/designsystemet-web` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` in your project.
Then use the components and functionality directly.

We do not yet generate framework-specific types.

## Documentation

The documentation will be continuously changed in the [README for the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet-web/v/0.0.0-fix-designsystemet-web-20260121152531), which you can read on NPM.
When the full release of the package is out, we will update the relevant documentation on designsystemet.no.

## Give feedback

We are very interested in hearing from you as a user!
If you discover errors, or have suggestions for improvements, you can create an issue in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new) or on [Slack](/slack).

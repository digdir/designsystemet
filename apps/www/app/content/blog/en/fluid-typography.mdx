With "Fluid typography," we can scale the text size gradually between a minimum and maximum width, instead of having an abrupt scaling at a specific breakpoint. The linear function approaches the desired size evenly across the screen width.

The text sizes increase gradually from a viewport width of 320px until it reaches the maximum width of the viewport, which is set to 1360px. A text of 16px will, for example, increase to 18px on the largest viewport.

## Advantages

- You don't have to think about breakpoints; the size of the font is automatically adjusted to the screen.
- When sizes aren't adjusted at specific breakpoints, we avoid piecemeal and sudden upscaling.

## Disadvantages

- Half pixels. Figma rounds down. Some browsers round up, others down. This means things don't look the same in Figma and in the browser.
- You may feel you have less control.
- In Figma, this size change can only happen using the "Token Studio" plugin when you have activated the desired viewport for your frame.
- It's not a given that a product will build its product using dynamic typography. If someone adds modules from the design system to their own interface, it won't match their scaling.

<br />

Based on [the disadvantages this caused](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/1444), we chose to go with a [static typography scale](/en/fundamentals/design-elements/typography#text-size) as the standard for the design system.

## Do you need dynamic typography?

If you need to use dynamic typography, please create a [feature request](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%92%A1feature+request%2Cneeds+prioritization%E2%9D%97%EF%B8%8F&projects=&template=2feature_request.yml), and we can consider the possibility of activating "Fluid" as a separate set.

The sizes used in the dynamic scale were generated using the [Fluid Typescale Generator](https://fluid-tokenization.vercel.app/)

| Step   | viewport 320px        | viewport 1360px       |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| f-3    | 12.00px / 0.75rem     | 12.00px / 0.75rem     |
| f-2    | 13.00px / 0.81rem     | 13.00px / 0.81rem     |
| f-1    | 15.00px / 0.94rem     | 16.00px / 1.00rem     |
| **f0** | **16.00px / 1.00rem** | **18.00px / 1.13rem** |
| f1     | 18.00px / 1.13rem     | 21.00px / 1.31rem     |
| f2     | 19.00px / 1.19rem     | 24.00px / 1.50rem     |
| f3     | 21.00px / 1.31rem     | 28.00px / 1.75rem     |
| f4     | 23.00px / 1.44rem     | 32.00px / 2.00rem     |
| f5     | 26.00px / 1.63rem     | 38.00px / 2.38rem     |
| f6     | 29.00px / 1.81rem     | 44.00px / 2.75rem     |

To see the correct text sizes in Figma, we were dependent on having the [Tokens Studio for Figma](https://docs.tokens.studio/) plugin installed and using it to activate the correct viewport. The video below shows how the plugin was used to get the correct text sizes for different viewports.

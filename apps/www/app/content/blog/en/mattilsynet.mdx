## From shared foundation to custom adaptations

At the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, we have long had high ambitions for user experience and accessibility. To achieve this efficiently, we chose to build on components, tokens, and principles from Designsystemet – instead of starting from scratch.

The cross-agency collaboration has made it possible to develop a flexible design system tailored to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority's visual profile, while also meeting requirements for universal design and scalability.

Both the Figma library and code package for the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are based on Designsystemet’s tokens and components. This provides a consistent and accessible foundation that can be adapted to our specific needs – such as a simplified color scale and custom alert colors for emergency materials.

Through Designsystemet’s design tokens, we can easily keep design and code in sync and make visual adjustments without compromising structure or quality.

## Technology that fits all teams

At the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, each development team is free to choose its own tech stack. For our design system to work in practice, it must therefore be framework-independent.

By combining the CSS package from Designsystemet with standardized CSS modules, we’ve found a solution that works in React, Vue, Svelte, and other technologies. Where JavaScript is needed – for example, for dropdowns or tooltips – we use simple event listeners to keep things flexible.

Although many associate Designsystemet with React components, it is much more than that. For us at the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the Figma library, CSS tokens, and documentation are invaluable resources – and we’ve chosen open source to share our work with others.

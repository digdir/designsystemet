<Alert>
All `@digdir/designsystemet-*` packages can be installed with version `VER_NUM`.

All prereleases will also be under the `test` tag on NPM.
</Alert>

## Test in existing application

We have updated the React package to use `@digdir/designsystemet-web` as the underlying framework-independent component library.
This means that some components that are currently implemented in React may be experienced differently since they now come from the web package.
Feel free to test these and provide feedback.

These are:
- Popover
- Dropdown
- Tooltip
- Dialog
- Pagination
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabs
- ToggleGroup
- Field

Please check all tests and console for errors or unexpected behavior.

`ToggleGroup` has been given a new internal structure, so that it no longer uses `<button>`.
The new structure is:
```html
<fieldset class="ds-toggle-group" data-toggle-group="Text alignment">
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="left" checked />
    Left aligned
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="center" />
    Centered
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="right" />
    Right aligned
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

## Testing in other frameworks or pure HTML/JS

To test the package without React, you can install `@digdir/designsystemet-web` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` in your project.
Then you can use the components and functionality directly.

Types are also generated for various frameworks.
You can get these by adding them to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
"compilerOptions": {
"types": ["@digdir/designsystemet-web"]
}
}
```

## Documentation

The documentation will be continuously changed in the [README for the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet-web/v/0.0.0-fix-designsystemet-web-20260121152531), which you can read on NPM.

When the complete release of the package is out, we will update the relevant documentation on designsystemet.no.

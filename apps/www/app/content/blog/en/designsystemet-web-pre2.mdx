<Alert>
All `@digdir/designsystemet-*` packages can be installed with version `VER_NUM`.

All prereleases will also be under the `test` tag on NPM.
</Alert>

## Test in existing application

We have updated `@digdir/designsystemet-react` to use `@digdir/designsystemet-web` as the underlying package for framework-independent interactivity.
No React components have breaking changes, but _may_ be experienced a little differently since they now come from the web package. That's why we need you to test and provide feedback:
Please test these and provide feedback.

These are:
- Popover
- Dropdown
- Tooltip
- Dialog
- Pagination
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabs
- ToggleGroup
- Field

Please check all tests and console to look for errors or unexpected behavior.

`ToggleGroup` still uses `ToggleGroup.Item` in React, but now internally does not create `<button>` anymore.
The new structure is:
```html
<fieldset class="ds-toggle-group" data-toggle-group="Text alignment">
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="left" checked />
    Left aligned
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="center" />
    Centered
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="alignment-two" value="right" />
    Right aligned
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

## Testing in other frameworks or pure HTML/JS

To test the package without React, you can install `@digdir/designsystemet-web` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` in your project.
Then you can use the components and functionality directly.

Types are also generated for various frameworks.
You can get these by adding them to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@digdir/designsystemet-web"]
  }
}
```

## Documentation

The documentation will be continuously changed in the [README for the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet-web/v/0.0.0-fix-designsystemet-web-20260121152531), which you can read on NPM.

When the complete release of the package is out, we will update the relevant documentation on designsystemet.no.

## Future plans

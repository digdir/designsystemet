You can now use Designsystemet - regardless of technology, in both new and old projects!

With the launch of the `@digdir/designsystemet-web` package, it has finally become possible to get all the benefits of Designsystemet without having to commit to React as a technology choice! This means both greater freedom and room for experimentation and innovation in new products, but also that older applications can benefit from Designsystemet without major rewrites.

As usual, all functionality is written in isolation, so you and your team can both choose what you want to use and not, or gradually adopt Designsystemet without the need for one big rewrite period.

For those of you using the `@digdir/designsystemet-react` package, there are no breaking changes; everything works as before, but under the hood, it is built on web standards instead of React hooks.

And not only that.. the web package can be used independently of the CSS package, so if you can build completely your own button components, but still take advantage of Designsystemet's pagination logic

## What's included?
The web package ensures that all interactivity and automated universal design that was previously done by the React package is now available to everyone.
Much of Designsystemet is already solved with pure web-standard HTML and CSS, while some components require a little extra intelligence.

Under is an overview of which components have their own web components:
- [Breadcrumbs](/no/components/docs/breadcrumbs) - `<ds-breadcrumbs>`
- [Error Summary](/no/components/docs/error-summary) - `<ds-error-summary>`
- [Field](/no/components/docs/field) - `<ds-field>`
- [Pagination](/no/components/docs/pagination) - `<ds-pagination>`
- [Suggestion](/no/components/docs/suggestion) - `<ds-suggestion>`
- [Tabs](/no/components/docs/tabs) - `<ds-tabs>`

## Why not web components for everything?
Designsystemet emphasizes using web standards. Introducing web components for everything would mean that we lose built-in flexibility and accessibility that pure HTML gives us for free, in addition to worse performance with dependency on Javascript.
Modern CSS with class and attribute selectors will in many cases provide better flexibility and performance.

Read more about why we have chosen not to create web components for all components in Designsystemet in [this blog post](/blog/no/designsystemet-web-webcomponents).

## Documentation

We are in the process of updating the documentation on designsystemet.no, but in the meantime, you can find temporary documentation for `@digdir/designsystemet-web` in the [README on Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/tree/main/packages/web).

## Feedback

We are very interested in hearing from you as a user!

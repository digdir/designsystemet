You can now use Designsystemet - regardless of technology, in both new and old projects!

With the launch of the `@digdir/designsystemet-web` package, it has finally become possible to get all the benefits of Designsystemet without having to commit to React as a technology choice! This means both greater freedom and room for experimentation and innovation in new products, but also that older applications can benefit from Designsystemet without major rewrites.

As usual, all functionality is written in isolation, so you and your team can both choose what you want to use and not, or gradually adopt Designsystemet without the need for one big rewrite period.

For those of you using the `@digdir/designsystemet-react` package, there are no breaking changes; everything works as before, but under the hood, it is built on web standards instead of React hooks.

And not only that.. the web package can be used independently of the CSS package, so if you can build completely your own button components, but still take advantage of Designsystemet's pagination logic

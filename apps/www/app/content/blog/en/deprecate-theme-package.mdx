After careful consideration, we have decided to deprecate the theme package (`@digdir/designsystemet-theme`) to simplify the usage of Designsystemet.

The theme package was initially created to facilitate themes for the Designsystemet. Over time with improvements to the [Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no), CLI and theming capabilities in Designsystemet, the need for a separate theme package has diminished. 

Most users today create and build their own themes rather than using the ones provided in the package, which is the approach we recommend. Learn more about how to create your own theme in our [documentation](/en/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme).

The default theme (available under `@digdir/designsystemet-theme`) has been moved to `@digdir/designsystemet-css/theme` making it easier to access and use and reducing the number of packages users need to install.

Digdir themes have been moved to an internal package, if you need access to these themes please reach out to us or copy the config from the [here](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/tree/main/internal/digdir).

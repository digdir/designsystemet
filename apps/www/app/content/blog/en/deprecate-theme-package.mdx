After careful consideration, we have decided to deprecate the theme package (`@digdir/designsystemet-theme`) to simplify the use of Designsystemet.

The theme package was originally created to enable sharing of themes in Designsystemet. Improvements to the [Theme builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no), the CLI, and other theming capabilities in Designsystemet have reduced the need for a separate theme package.

Most users today create and build their own themes rather than using the ones provided in the package, which is the approach we recommend. Learn more about how to create your own theme in our [documentation](/en/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme).

We have moved the default theme, previously available in `@digdir/designsystemet-theme`, to `@digdir/designsystemet-css/theme`. This makes it easier to use and reduces the number of packages users need to install.

Digdir themes have been moved to an internal package. If you need access to these themes, please contact us or copy the configuration from [GitHub (github.com)](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/tree/main/internal/digdir).

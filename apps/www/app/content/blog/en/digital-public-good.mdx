We are proud to share that Designsystemet has officially been recognized as a *digital public good* by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA). This means that Designsystemet meets the DPG standard and is available for use and reuse worldwide!

Through this recognition, Designsystemet becomes part of an international community of digital public goods that support sustainable development and inclusive digital services.

**Designsystemet is now listed in the [DPG Registry](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/designsystemet)**, and through that it will also be available in several catalogs and networks that highlight open and reusable solutions.


## Why is this important?
This recognition is an important milestone that raises the visibility of our work internationally and can open new opportunities for collaboration across borders.

- The recognition confirms that Designsystemet is relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and meets the requirements for openness and reusability.  
- The status strengthens Designsystemet’s role as a shared resource for creating inclusive and universally designed digital services.  
- It highlights Norway’s contribution to openness, collaboration, and user-centered solutions on a global scale.

## Building a global community
This recognition is not only about international visibility. It is also about building a stronger community across borders, while bringing direct value back to Norway. We want to co-create, learn from others, and build on each other’s work. We need to become better at using our resources more effectively. More than ever, it is important to collaborate, help each other, and share technology—both nationally and internationally. The whole idea behind digital public goods supports exactly this mindset.

Just like with digital common solutions, we don’t need to develop what already exists. By building on open source, open standards, and open content that follow best practices, we enable others to adopt and further develop our solutions. If someone, for example, adopts Designsystemet and builds upon it, the results can benefit both The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir) and other public sector organizations.

This benefits everyone, both those who reuse the code and those who contribute to its further development. As technology evolves at an ever-faster pace, we all need to keep up. Digital solutions and products must be continuously improved, and the more people who contribute, the more robust the solutions become. It also makes it possible to respond to new needs faster, including in the area of security.

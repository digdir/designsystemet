We are proud to share that Designsystemet has officially been recognized as a *digital public good* by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA). This means that Designsystemet meets the DPG Standard and is available for adoption and reuse worldwide!  

Through this recognition, Designsystemet becomes part of an international community of digital public goods that support sustainable development and inclusive digital services.  

Soon, Designsystemet will be listed in the [DPG Registry](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/registry), and through it also appear in other catalogs and networks that highlight open and reusable solutions.  

## Why is this important?

- The recognition confirms that Designsystemet is relevant to the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals) and meets the requirements of openness and reusability.  

- The status strengthens Designsystemet’s role as a shared resource for creating inclusive and universally designed digital services.  

- It highlights Norway’s contribution to openness, collaboration, and user-centered solutions globally.  

This is a milestone that not only showcases our work internationally but also opens new opportunities for collaboration across borders.

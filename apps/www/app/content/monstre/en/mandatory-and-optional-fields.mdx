There are several ways to mark mandatory fields that [meet the marking requirements](https://www.uutilsynet.no/veiledning/skjema/38#ledetekster_og_instruksjoner). Today, we do this differently across different systems. Some use an asterisk (star), some use words, others inform in advance about what needs to be filled out. If we can make this more consistent across systems, it will be easier for citizens to understand and recognize the pattern across our solutions. There will always be exceptions and different contexts that require different marking.

A general guideline is that we should avoid asking for information we don't need, thus avoiding optional fields.

Here we cover 3 examples.

1. [One question per page](#1-one-question-per-page)
2. [When we _must_ have multiple questions per page](#2-when-we-must-have-multiple-questions-per-page)
3. [When we _must_ have a combination of mandatory and optional fields](#3-when-we-must-have-a-combination-of-mandatory-and-optional-fields)

## 1. One question per page

If we can stick to one question per page, that is the simplest for the user. When we do this, we don't need to mark which fields must be filled out. The description will make it clear that this must be filled out.

  src='/img/obligatorisk-eks1.png'
  alt='Screenshot of a form with one question on a page, where the question is mandatory'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

If it is optional to fill out one of the pages, this can also be made clear in the description.

<Image
  src='/img/obligatorisk-eks1b.png'
  alt='Screenshot of a form with one question on a page, where the question is optional'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

## 2. When we _must_ have multiple questions per page

If we _must_ have multiple questions on a page, we can clearly inform at the top that _all fields must be filled out_. We should only ask the user for information we absolutely need, and avoid optional fields. (If you cannot avoid optional fields, see [example 3](#3-when-we-must-have-a-combination-of-mandatory-and-optional-fields)).

- Use, for example, a yellow tag, as shown in the example below.
- Use the text **"All fields must be filled out"**. \
  (_Don't_ use _"Mandatory"_ or _"Required"_)
- Make sure there aren't too many questions on the same page. What is on the same page should have the same theme or questions that are related to each other.

    src='/img/obligatorisk-eks2.png'
    alt='Screenshot of a form with multiple questions per page.'
    boxShadow={false}
  />

## 3. When we _must_ have a combination of mandatory and optional fields

A combination of mandatory and optional fields is not ideal! But there will be situations where we cannot avoid it. If we _must_ include optional fields in addition to the mandatory ones, we should mark all fields individually. In this case, we don't need to inform at the top.

- Clearly inform with the tag "Must be filled out" or "Optional" after each question/label.
- Don't use the words "Mandatory" or "Required".
- Use, for example, a yellow tag for "Must be filled out" and blue for optional.
- Don't use a star to mark fields that must be filled out.

  src='/img/obligatorisk-eks3.png'
  alt='Screenshot of a form with multiple questions per page, both mandatory and optional.'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

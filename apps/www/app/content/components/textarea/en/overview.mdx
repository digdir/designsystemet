**Use `Textarea` when**
- users need to write more than one line of text  
- free-form input is required  
- the answer does not follow a fixed structure  

**Avoid using `Textarea` when**
- short answers are expected, use [`Textfield`](/en/components/textfield/overview) instead  
- the input consists of structured data that requires validation

## Example

### With rows
Developers can set how many rows a `Textarea` should have by using the `rows` attribute. This only affects the initial height of the field.

It is useful for giving users an indication of how much text is expected.

### Disabled
Avoid disabling a `Textarea` if possible. It can be difficult for users to understand why the field cannot be used. Read more about [why disabled states are problematic (nav.no)](https://aksel.nav.no/god-praksis/artikler/deaktiverte-tilstander) and which alternatives to consider.

### ReadOnly
Since a text field is normally expected to be editable, `readOnly` can be confusing. Use it only when it is truly necessary. In many cases, it is better to display the information as plain text rather than in a `readOnly` field.

Fields with the `readonly` attribute remain part of the tab order. Users can copy the content but cannot change it, and the information is submitted with the form. For this reason, `readOnly` can be appropriate when the information must be included in a summary that is submitted as part of the form.

**Important: If you choose to use `readOnly`, you must explain to the user why the content cannot be edited.**

## Guidelines
Use `Textarea` when users are expected to write more than one line of text, for example open questions, feedback, or other situations requiring longer input.

Be aware that some users find free-text fields challenging. In certain cases, it may be better to break the question into smaller, more structured parts and let users answer with components such as `Radio`.

### Size and adaptation

#### Height
The height of the `Textarea` should reflect the expected amount of text. If you expect approximately three lines of input, the initial height should match this. For longer responses, provide more visual space to ensure a good user experience. You can set the height with `rows="{number}"`.

`Textarea` should expand in height when users need more space. Unless `rows` is set, the field will automatically grow as the user types so they can see their full input without scrolling.

#### Width
A `Textarea` should not be wider than 50–75 characters including spaces. Staying within this range ensures the best readability for all users.

### Additional guidelines
In addition to these recommendations, follow the general guidelines for [`Textfield`](/en/components/textfield/overview):

* [Input and formatting](/en/components/textfield/overview#inndata)

## Alert in a live region

If you want the alert to be read out dynamically, you must place the `Alert` inside a live region. The region **must wrap around** the `Alert` component, not be placed on the component itself.

Out of the box, `Alert` is presented to screen reader users as regular static content. For alerts that appear dynamically, you can define a *live region* for screen readers yourself, but be aware of the behaviour this introduces. You can read more about this in [MDN’s documentation on ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions).

Pay particular attention to the fact that the live region — that is, the element with the attribute `role="alert"`, `role="status"`, or `aria-live` with the value `"assertive"` or `"polite"` — must exist on the page **before** the alert that is to be read out.

For dynamic alerts, it is generally most relevant to use `role="alert"` for critical alerts or `role="status"` for less critical alerts, as described in the [system notifications pattern](https://designsystemet.no/no/patterns/systemnotifications). See also the [alert role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role) and the [status role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/status_role) on MDN.

**Do not** combine `role="alert"` and `aria-live`, since [this may cause the alert to be read out twice in VoiceOver (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions#:~:text=adding%20both%20aria%2Dlive%20and%20role=%22alert%22%20causes%20double%20speaking%20issues%20in%20VoiceOver%20on%20iOS).

You **should** combine `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` [to maximise compatibility (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions#roles_with_implicit_live_region_attributes).

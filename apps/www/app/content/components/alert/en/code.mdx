The icon is controlled via CSS.

### Alert in live region

If you want the alert to be read dynamically, you must place `Alert` in a live region.
The region **should be around** the `Alert` component, not on it.

Out of the box, `Alert` is presented to screen reader users as regular static content. For alerts that occur dynamically, you can define a *live region* for screen readers, but be aware of the behavior this will cause.
You can read more about this in the [MDN documentation on ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions).

Note in particular that the live region — that is, the element with the attribute `role="alert"`, `role="status"`, or `aria-live` with the value `"assertive"` or `"polite"` — must exist on the page **before** the alert that is to be spoken.

For dynamic notifications, it is most appropriate to use `role="alert"` for critical notifications or `role="status"` for less critical ones, as described in the [pattern for system notifications](https://designsystemet.no/no/patterns/systemnotifications). See also [alert role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role) and [status role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/status_role) at MDN.

**Do not** combine `role="alert"` and `aria-live`, as [this causes the alert to be spoken twice in VoiceOver (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions#:~:text=adding%20both%20aria%2Dlive%20and%20role=%22alert%22%20causes%20double%20speaking%20issues%20in%20VoiceOver%20on%20iOS).

You **should** combine `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` [to maximize compatibility (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions#roles_with_implicit_live_region_attributes).

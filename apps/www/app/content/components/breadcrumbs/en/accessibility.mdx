`Breadcrumbs` can contain multiple interactive elements that must be navigable with the keyboard. Therefore, make sure that the [`SkipLink`](/en/components/docs/skip-link/overview) of the main content also skips `Breadcrumbs`.

## Last level
The last link should correspond to the current page. It looks like regular text, but is coded as a link with `aria-current="page"`. This way, screen readers get the correct information about which page the user is on, without other users mistakenly perceiving it as a clickable link.

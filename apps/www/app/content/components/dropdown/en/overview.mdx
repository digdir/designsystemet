**Use `Dropdown` when**
- you want to offer multiple options without taking up much space in the interface
- the options are secondary but should still be easily accessible

**Avoid `Dropdown` when**
- an action is primary or frequently used; use a visible [`Button`](/no/components/button/overview) instead
- there is only one option, as a dropdown adds unnecessary complexity

## Example

### With icons

You can use icons together with text in the dropdown items:

<Story story="Icons" />

## Guidelines

`Dropdown` does not create a semantic menu, but provides the foundation for building one yourself. Read the ["Menu and Menubar Pattern" on w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/) for more information on how to create accessible menus.

- Use `Dropdown` for actions or navigation that do not need to be visible at all times  
- Keep the number of items manageable  
- Use headings to group related items  
- Avoid multiple levels of dropdowns (nested menus)

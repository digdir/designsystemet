## Usage

`Dropdown` consists of several sub-components:

- `Dropdown.TriggerContext` - Wrapper to connect trigger and dropdown
- `Dropdown.Trigger` - The button that opens the menu
- `Dropdown` - The dropdown menu itself
- `Dropdown.Heading` - Heading in the menu
- `Dropdown.List` - List of items
- `Dropdown.Item` - An item in the list
- `Dropdown.Button` - Button inside an item

## Guidelines

- Use Dropdown for actions or navigation that don't need to be visible all the time
- Keep the number of items manageable
- Use headings to group related items
- Avoid multiple levels of dropdowns (nested menus)

## With icons

You can use icons together with text in dropdown items:

<Story story="Icons" />

## Controlled state

You can control when the dropdown is open or closed:

<Story story="Controlled" />

## Without TriggerContext

You can also use Dropdown without TriggerContext by using `popovertarget`:

<Story story="WithoutTrigger" />

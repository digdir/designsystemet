**Use `Dropdown` when**
- you want to offer multiple options without taking up much space in the interface
- the options are secondary but should still be easily accessible

**Avoid `Dropdown` when**
- an action is primary or frequently used; use a visible [`Button`](/en/components/docs/button/overview) instead
- there is only one option, as a dropdown adds unnecessary complexity

## Example

### With icons

You can use icons together with text in the dropdown items:

<Story story="Icons" />

## Guidelines

`Dropdown` does not create a semantic menu, but provides the foundation for building one yourself. Read the ["Menu and Menubar Pattern" on w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/) for more information on how to create accessible menus.

- Use `Dropdown` for actions or navigation that do not need to be visible at all times  
- Keep the number of items manageable  
- Use headings to group related items  
- Avoid multiple levels of dropdowns (nested menus)

## Notes

### Arrow key navigation
Arrow key navigation in `Dropdown` is something we do not recommend; regular Tab navigation is sufficient.

The reason is; if you implement arrow key navigation, you should also use `role="menu"` on the `Dropdown` and `role="menuitem"` on the options. This affects screen reader users as the navigation mode changes (for example "browse/scanning mode" in NVDA, "forms mode" in JAWS, and "quick nav" in VoiceOver).
While the specification and intention behind this pattern is good, it can feel unfamiliar and in some cases disruptive for end users.

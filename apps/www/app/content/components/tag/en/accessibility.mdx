<Alert data-color="info">
We are working to improve the accessibility documentation for this component. If you have questions or see something that should be prioritised, please contact us on [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?template=1bug_report.yml) or [Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack).
</Alert>

If you are displaying several `Tag` components together, we recommend using a `<ul>` list with one `<li>` per `Tag`. This ensures that they are announced as a list rather than as one continuous sentence, providing a better experience for users of assistive technologies.

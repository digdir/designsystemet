<Story layout="block" story="Preview" />

**Use `Details` when**

- less important content should be optional to open
- additional information may be useful for some users
- you need to provide examples or answer frequently asked questions

**Avoid `Details` when**

- important content needs to be visible as soon as users arrive on the page
- error messages must be summarised, use [`ErrorSummary`](/en/components/docs/error-summary/overview) instead

## Example

You can use `Details` inside a card to give the content a framed appearance. This works well when `Details` does not span the full width of the page, or when it contains only a single line.

## Guidelines
Large amounts of text can be demanding for many users. The `Details` component allows users to decide for themselves what is relevant to read. However, you should not use `Details` to hide content just to make the page look tidier. When content is hidden, there is a risk that users will not notice it at all. Carefully consider whether the content really needs to be hidden, and be clear about why you are doing so.

### Avoid nested lists

Do not place one `Details` inside another. Nested lists can make it difficult for users to understand what is open and what is closed, especially when several levels can be expanded at once.

## Text

Make sure the heading clearly describes what the `Details` contains.  Headings can strongly influence whether users find what they need, whether the content is read, and whether it is considered accessible to all.

“Show more” or “Read more here” are not good enough headings. If you have many expandable sections, consider adding a main heading or thematic heading above the entire list.

Keep the content inside `Details` short so it is easy to relate to the heading. If the content is too long, divide it into several `Details`. For very large amounts of content, it may be better to create separate pages.

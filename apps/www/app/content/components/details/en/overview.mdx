## Usage

`Details` consists of two sub-components:

- `Details.Summary` - The heading that can be clicked to show/hide content
- `Details.Content` - The content that is shown/hidden

## Guidelines

- Use Details when you have content that not all users need to see immediately
- Keep the heading short and descriptive
- Avoid hiding important information that users always need

## Accessibility

The Details component uses native HTML elements `<details>` and `<summary>`, which have built-in accessibility support.

## In Card

Details can be used inside the Card component for nice grouping:

<Story layout="block" story="InCard" />

## Color variants

Details works well with Card's color variants:

<Story layout="block" story="InCardWithColor" />

## Controlled state

You can control whether Details is open or closed:

<Story layout="block" story="Controlled" />

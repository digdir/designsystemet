**Use `Details` when**

- you want to provide information that is only relevant to some users
- you want to give examples or answer frequently asked questions
- it should be up to the user whether they choose to read the content

**Avoid `Details` when**
- you need to show important content that everyone should see
- you need to display an action button
- you need to summarise error messages, use [`ErrorSummary`](/en/components/docs/error-summary/overview) instead

<Card data-color="info">
  `Details` is the same pattern that many know as an *accordion*. The name comes from the built-in HTML `<details>` element, which provides good accessibility and semantics without additional JavaScript.
</Card>

## Example

You can use `Details` inside a card to give the content a framed appearance. This works well when `Details` does not span the full width of the page, or when it contains only a single line.

## Guidelines
Large amounts of text can be demanding for many users. The `Details` component allows users to decide for themselves what is relevant to read. However, you should not use `Details` to hide content just to make the page look tidier. When content is hidden, there is a risk that users will not notice it at all. Carefully consider whether the content really needs to be hidden, and be clear about why you are doing so.

### Avoid nested lists

Do not place one `Details` inside another. Nested lists can make it difficult for users to understand what is open and what is closed, especially when several levels can be expanded at once.

## Text

Make sure the heading clearly describes what the `Details` contains.  Headings can strongly influence whether users find what they need, whether the content is read, and whether it is considered accessible to all.

“Show more” or “Read more here” are not good enough headings. If you have many expandable sections, consider adding a main heading or thematic heading above the entire list.

Keep the content inside `Details` short so it is easy to relate to the heading. If the content is too long, divide it into several `Details`. For very large amounts of content, it may be better to create separate pages.

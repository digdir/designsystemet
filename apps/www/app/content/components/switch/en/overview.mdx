We use `Switch` to give users a choice between two alternatives. The switch can either be turned off or on.

<Story story="Preview" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Switch label="Dark mode" value="dark" />
```

## Code Examples

### Checked

<Story story="Checked" />

### Grouping

<Story story="Group" />

### Right aligned

<Story story="RightAligned" />

## Guidelines

`Switch` should be a choice between two alternatives. We use `Switch` for settings, not in forms.

**Suitable for**

- activating or deactivating features/states immediately
- turning notifications off and on

**Not suitable for**

- using instead of `Checkbox` or `Radio` in a form
- situations where users must save information before a change takes effect

## Accessibility

We use `role="switch"` to tell screen readers that this is a toggle switch.

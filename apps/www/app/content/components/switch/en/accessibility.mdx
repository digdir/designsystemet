We use `role="switch"` to inform screen readers that this is a toggle switch. This allows screen readers to tell the user that it is a switch and that it can be turned on and off. We do not add `aria-checked` because it is not necessary when the switch is an input with `type="checkbox"`. <sup>1</sup>

### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles the switch on and off

We are working to improve the accessibility documentation for this component. If you have questions or see something that should be prioritised, please contact us on [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?template=1bug_report.yml) or [Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack).

We use `role="switch"` to inform screen readers that this is a toggle switch. This allows screen readers to tell the user that it is a switch and that it can be turned on and off. We do not add `aria-checked` because it is not necessary when the switch is an input with `type="checkbox"`. <sup>1</sup>

### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles the switch on and off

**Use `Skeleton` when**
- you need to indicate that content on a page is in the process of loading  
- you want to show users what the layout of the content will look like once it has loaded  
- the content is expected to take more than one second to load

**Avoid `Skeleton` when**
- you need to indicate that the system is working on a task the user must wait for, use a [`Spinner`](/en/components/spinner/overview) instead

## Example

### Variants

`Skeleton` comes in three variants: `rectangle`, `circle`, and `text`.

### Usage example

<Story story="UsageExample" layout="column" />

### Text variant

## Guidelines

`Skeleton` is an alternative to [`Spinner`](/en/components/spinner/overview) when you want to indicate that content is loading. It helps users understand what is coming and can make the waiting time feel shorter.

Choose the `Skeleton` variant based on the type of content being loaded, such as headings, text blocks or images. Try to mimic the structure of the actual content to make the transition to the fully loaded content feel smooth.

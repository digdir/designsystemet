`Skeleton` is used to show that content on a page is being loaded. Instead of showing a [`Spinner`](/docs/komponenter-loaders-spinner--docs) that only indicates something is happening, `Skeleton` can give the user a visual hint of how the content will eventually look.

import { Skeleton } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Skeleton width={200} height={100} />
```

## Code Examples

### Variants

### Text Variant

<Story story="Text" />

## Guidelines

`Skeleton` is an alternative to `Spinner` when you want to indicate that content is being loaded. `Skeleton` helps users better understand what's coming and perceive the wait time as shorter.

**Suitable for**

- indicating that content on a page is being loaded
- giving the user an indication of how the content will look when loaded
- using in areas where content is expected to take more than 1 second to load

**Not suitable for**

- indicating that the system is working on a task the user must wait for (use [Spinner](/docs/komponenter-loaders-spinner--docs) instead)

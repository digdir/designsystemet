**Use `Chip` when**
- users need to filter information, for example in lists or tables
- active filters should be displayed

**Avoid `Chip` when**
- you need to show status or numbers, use [`Badge`](/en/components/docs/badge/overview) instead
- content should be labelled with a non-interactive category or topic, use [`Tag`](/en/components/docs/tag/overview) instead
- you are creating menus or navigation elements

## Example

### `Chip.Checkbox`

`Chip.Checkbox` can be used as an alternative to `Checkbox`.

<Story story="CheckboxVariant" />

### `Chip.Removable`

`Chip.Removable` includes a cross icon indicating that the filter can be removed.  
It is important to add an `aria-label` if the chip’s text does not make it clear that it can be removed.

### `Chip.Button`

`Chip.Button` can be used as an alternative to `Button`.

<Story story="AsButton" />

## Guidelines

`Chip` allows users to control how they want to display content.

Avoid placing `Chip` vertically. If you need to show options stacked vertically, use [`Checkbox`](/en/components/docs/checkbox/overview) or [`Radio`](/en/components/docs/radio/overview) instead. A group of `Chip` components may wrap across multiple lines.

## Text

`Chip` should contain as few words as possible, preferably just one or two.

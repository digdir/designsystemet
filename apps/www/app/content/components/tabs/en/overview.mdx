**Use `Tabs` when**  
* content needs to be structured without loading a new page  
* information benefits from being divided into clearly labelled sections  
* navigation becomes easier when users do not need to view all content at once  

**Avoid using `Tabs` when**  
* it is important to give an immediate overview of the content  
* information needs to be compared across sections  
* users must go through a step-by-step process where the order matters  
* large amounts of content may slow down the page  
* the content could just as well be shown on a single page or spread across several pages  

## Example

### Icons only
`Tabs` can be displayed with icons only for a more compact layout.  
Ensure that the icons are intuitive and have descriptive titles for screen readers.  
In the example below, we wrap `Tabs.Tab` in a [`Tooltip`](/en/components/docs/tooltip/code) to provide descriptive text for the icons.

### Icons with text
Combining icons with text provides both a visual and textual description of the content.  
Icons should be decorative and marked with `aria-hidden`.

## Guidelines

`Tabs` are used to organise related content into separate sections.

### Alternatives to Tabs
Before choosing `Tabs`, consider whether it might be better to:
- simplify and reduce the amount of content
- distribute the content across several pages
- keep everything on a single page with clear headings
- use a table of contents for easier navigation

### Best practice
- **Limit the number of `Tabs`** – too many make it difficult to get an overview, especially on small screens  
- **Use clear, descriptive names** – `Tabs` hide content, so it must be obvious what each section contains  
- **Place the most important content first** – organise `Tabs` according to users’ needs  
- **Keep `Tabs` on a single line** – long labels or too many `Tabs` make navigation harder  
- **Avoid disabled `Tabs`** – remove them or explain why they contain no content  

## Text
`Tabs` labels should be short and descriptive so users can easily understand what they will find when clicking.  
If it is difficult to create clear labels, it may indicate that the content is not well structured.

If additional context is needed, a shared heading can be placed above the `Tabs` component.  
This can act as an overall description, giving users a quick overview of what the `Tabs` contain.

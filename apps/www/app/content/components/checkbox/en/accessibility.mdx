It must be possible to move focus to the `Checkbox` by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> on the keyboard. It must also be possible to check and uncheck it by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>.

### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles the state

### Use a label

A `Checkbox` must always have an accessible name. In most cases, this will be a `<label>`. In special cases, it may make sense to omit the `<label>` and instead use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. An example of both of these aria attributes is shown in the use of `Checkbox` in the table further up the page.

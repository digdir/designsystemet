<Story story="Preview" />

## Usage

`Popover` consists of several sub-components:

- `Popover.TriggerContext` - Wrapper to connect trigger and popover
- `Popover.Trigger` - The element that opens the popover (can be a button or inline text)
- `Popover` - The popover content itself

## Guidelines

- Use Popover for additional information that doesn't need to be visible all the time
- Keep content short and relevant
- Use color variants to indicate different types of content (neutral, info, warning, danger)
- Avoid critical information in Popover that users must see

## Interactive popover

Popover can contain buttons and other interactive elements:

<Story story="Interactive" />

## Inline trigger

You can use Popover inline in text with a dotted underline:

<Story story="DottedUnderline" />

## Controlled state

You can control when the popover is open or closed:

<Story story="Controlled" />

## Without TriggerContext

You can also use Popover without TriggerContext by using `popovertarget`:

<Story story="WithoutContext" />

## Color variants

Popover supports the following color variants:
- `neutral` - Standard gray color
- `info` - Blue information color
- `warning` - Yellow warning color
- `danger` - Red danger color

Each variant also has a `tinted` version that is lighter.

<Story story="PreviewEn" />

**Use `Popover` when**
- you need to provide additional explanations that require more space than a short [`Tooltip`](/en/components/tooltip), such as definitions or detailed instructions
- context-specific help is needed that users can open and close without leaving the page
- supplementary information should be shown that is not critical for completing the task, but may be useful for some users

**Avoid `Popover` when**
- you need to describe a symbol or keyboard shortcut; use [`Tooltip`](/en/components/tooltip) instead
- the purpose is navigation or choosing between options; use [`Dropdown`](/en/components/dropdown) instead
- the content is intended to appear on hover

## Example

### Interactive popover

A popover may contain buttons and other interactive elements:

<Story story="InteractiveEn" />

### Inline trigger

You can use Popover inline in text with a dotted underline:

<Story story="DottedUnderlineEn" />

### Controlled state

You can control when the popover is opened or closed:

<Story story="ControlledEn" />

### Without TriggerContext

You can also use Popover without TriggerContext by using `popovertarget`:

<Story story="WithoutContextEn" />

## Guidelines

`Popover` is used to display more detailed or interactive supplementary information without taking the user out of context. It can be used as an extended solution when a [`Tooltip`](/no/components/tooltip) is not sufficient. `Popover` is opened through an intentional user click and may contain text, links and simple form elements. The content should be short, relevant, and not critical for completing the task.

### Placement

`Popover` can be placed as needed, and will automatically stay within the visible browser area. This behaviour can be disabled using `autoPlacement`.

## Text

Avoid long texts and complex explanations. In some cases, it may be better to link to another page with more detailed information on the topic.

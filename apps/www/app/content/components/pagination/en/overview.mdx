**Use `Pagination` when**
- search results or large amounts of data need to be divided across multiple pages
- users need to understand where they are within a larger set of content
- loading the entire dataset at once would be too heavy or result in poor performance

**Avoid `Pagination` when**
- the total amount of content is small enough to fit on a single page
- you want to divide a form into several pages
- progress needs to be displayed

## Example

### With links

You can use Pagination with anchor links for improved navigation.

<Story story="WithAnchorEn" />

### Mobile variant

On mobile devices, you can show fewer pages and remove the text for previous/next.

<Story story="MobileEn" />

## Guidelines

Use `Pagination` when content is too large for a single page, such as search results or long lists, and the user needs to navigate back and forth.  
Content should only be split across multiple pages if it improves loading time or usability.

## Text

We use a fixed pattern for `Pagination` with the words “Previous” and “Next”.

Avoid “Previous page”, “Next page”, “Go back”, “Go forward”, “Continue” and “Back”.

We are working to improve the accessibility documentation for this component. If you have questions or see something that should be prioritised, please contact us on [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?template=1bug_report.yml) or [Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack).

A `<label>` must always be associated with a form element to ensure good accessibility.
This is done by using the `for` attribute (`htmlFor` in React), which points to the `id` attribute of the corresponding form element.

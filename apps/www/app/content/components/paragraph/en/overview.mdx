## Guidelines
Keep paragraphs focused and well structured, and break up long blocks of text into smaller sections to make the content easier to scan and understand. Ensure that line length and spacing support good readability.

## Text
Body text should be clear, concise, and written in plain language. Start with the most important information so users can quickly understand the context.

Each paragraph should cover one topic or idea at a time. When explaining complex information, divide it into several paragraphs to avoid cognitive overload and make the content easier for everyone to follow.

<Story story="Preview" />

**Use `AvatarStack` when**
- A group of people or entities should be displayed together, but space is limited.
- You need to signal that multiple people are involved, without showing everyone at full size.

**Avoid `AvatarStack` when**
- There is only ever a single avatar to display.
- Each person or entity must be clearly identifiable by name or role at the same time.


## Examples

### Customization
`AvatarStack` is designed to be flexible enough to cover many different needs and use cases.
<Story story="Playground" layout='block' />

### Sizes
The size of avatars in an `AvatarStack` is controlled via `avatarSize` and can be specified in any valid CSS size unit for maximum flexibility.
<Story story="DataSize" layout='block' />

### Gap
The visible space between avatars can be customized with `gap` 
<Story story="Gap" layout='block' />

### Expandable
In some cases, it may be desirable to expand the stack on hover and focus. This functionality is off by default.
<Story story="Expandable" layout='block' />

### Variants
`AvatarStack` supports both round and square variants, but only one variant per stack.
<Story story="ShapeVariants" layout='block' />

### Indicating avatars not shown
When there are more avatars than can be displayed in the stack, there are two different ways to indicate this.
<Story story="AdditionalAvatars" layout='block' />

### Tooltips and links
Avatars in AvatarStack can have tooltips and be links, but be aware of accessibility considerations.
<Story story="WithTooltipAndLink" layout='block' />

## Guidelines
`AvatarStack` should be used with caution, as it can be challenging for users to identify individual avatars in a tightly packed stack. Ensure that the use of `AvatarStack` makes sense in the context of the user experience and does not compromise accessibility or usability.

AvatarStack does not support wrapping across multiple lines. If there are more avatars than can fit in the stack, you can use `suffix` or an additional `Avatar` with `+xx` to indicate the number of hidden avatars.

## Text
`aria-label` or `aria-description` can be used on `AvatarStack` to provide context to screen readers about what the stack represents, for example "Meeting participants" or "Team members".

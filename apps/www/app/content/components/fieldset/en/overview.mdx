**Use `Fieldset` when**
- you have a group or list of multiple `Radio` or `Checkbox` components that naturally belong together
- a form needs to be divided into sections with explanatory headings
- several fields naturally belong together such as contact information

**Avoid `Fieldset` when**
- you are grouping elements that are not part of a form
- the fields do not share a common purpose

## Example

### Checkbox

There may be scenarios where a `Fieldset` contains only one `Checkbox`, depending on the context. Below is an example of such a scenario.

<Story story="WithCheckbox" />

### Legend as a heading

Using the question itself as a heading is good practice in many cases, because screen reader users then hear the question only once.

On pages with several input fields that relate to the same question, it is easier for screen reader users if the question is a heading. This makes it clearer that all the fields that follow belong to the group indicated by the heading.

In the example below, we use an `<h1>`, which would act as the main heading of the page, together with the `<legend>`.

<Story story="LegendAsHeading" />

## Guidelines

When using `Fieldset`, start with a `Fieldset.Legend` that explains what the fields below relate to. This may be a question such as “Where do you currently live?” or a descriptive phrase like “Personal details”. This helps users understand the relationship between the fields and what they need to fill in.

## Text

Avoid using the same text in both `<label>` and `<legend>`. Include helper text (`Fieldset.Description`) if it makes the form easier to complete. Note that the description is not associated with the input fields. Keep the text as short as possible.

### Keyboard interaction

* Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> clears the search field to provide a consistent experience across browsers.
* <kbd>Tab</kbd> navigation allows users to move between the input field, the clear button and the search button.
* <kbd>Enter</kbd> submits the search when the input field has focus.

### Screen reader support
Placeholder text should not be used as the only description, as screen readers handle it differently and it can create confusion.

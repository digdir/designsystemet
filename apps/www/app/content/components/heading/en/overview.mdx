`Heading` is a typography component used to display text in different sizes and styles. Use it for page titles, section headers, and subheadings. Headings are designed to stand out from body text, create visual hierarchy, and help readers quickly understand the structure of the content.

### Sizes

<Story story="Sizes" layout="column" />

## Guidelines

`Heading` is used to establish structure and hierarchy in content. Use headings to divide information into clear, logical sections. Make sure to use [correct heading levels](/en/components/docs/heading/accessibility#riktige-overskriftsnivåer) (h1-h6) to ensure proper semantic structure.

## Text

Headings and subheadings should be short and clear, giving readers an accurate idea of the content they introduce. Starting headings with keywords makes it easier for everyone to scan the page and locate relevant information.

The main page heading — the `<h1>` element — must describe the entire page, while each subheading should be unique and clearly indicate what the following section contains.

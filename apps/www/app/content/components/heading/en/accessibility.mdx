## Correct heading levels

Use headings in the correct order (`h1`-`h6`) to create a clear and predictable structure. Many users navigate by skimming the headings, and it is therefore essential that the hierarchy is coherent and provides a logical division of the content. A tidy heading structure also makes it easier for assistive technologies to present the page correctly.

Avoid skipping levels in the hierarchy. Moving from `<h2>` to `<h3>` is natural, while jumping from `<h2>` to `<h4>` can make it harder to understand how the content is organised.

Be consistent across pages and sections in your solution. If a table of contents uses `<h2>` in one place, the same structure should apply everywhere. Both the visual style and the semantic HTML should be the same for the corresponding heading level. This helps users build a stable mental model of how the content is organised.

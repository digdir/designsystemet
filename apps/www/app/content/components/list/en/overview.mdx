<Story story="Preview" />

**Use `List` when**
- users need a quick overview of content in longer texts
- several steps in a process should be listed
- criteria need to be presented clearly

**Avoid `List` when**
- users are expected to read longer blocks of text
- several groups of information need to be compared, use a [`Table`](/en/components/table/overview) instead

## Example

### Unordered list

<Story story="Unordered" layout="column" />

### Ordered list

<Story story="Ordered" layout="column" />

## Guidelines

Lists make content easier to scan and understand. Use ordered lists when the sequence matters, and unordered lists when it does not. Be mindful of structure and avoid long lists. Consider splitting content into several shorter lists to improve readability.

### List or table?

Lists and tables serve different purposes. Using the correct component makes the experience clearer for all users, especially for those with cognitive or learning difficulties, or those using screen readers.

- A list presents related information in a clear, scannable way.  
- A table allows users to view and compare multiple groups of information.

## Text

All items in a list should follow the same form and structure.

When each item continues from the introduction, use:
- lower-case at the start of each point  
- no colon after the introduction  
- no full stop or comma at the end of each point  

When each item is a full sentence, use:
- an initial capital letter so each point reads as a separate sentence  
- a full stop at the end of each point to indicate completion

**Use `List` when**
- users need a quick overview of content in longer texts
- several steps in a process should be listed
- criteria need to be presented clearly

**Avoid `List` when**
- users are expected to read longer blocks of text
- several groups of information need to be compared, use a [`Table`](/en/components/docs/table/overview) instead

## Example

### Unordered list

<Story story="UnorderedEn" layout="column" />

### Ordered list

<Story story="OrderedEn" layout="column" />

## Guidelines

Lists make content easier to scan and understand. Use ordered lists when the sequence matters, and unordered lists when it does not. Be mindful of structure and avoid long lists. Consider splitting content into several shorter lists to improve readability.

### List or table?

Lists and tables serve different purposes. Using the correct component makes the experience clearer for all users, especially for those with cognitive or learning difficulties, or those using screen readers.

- A list presents related information in a clear, scannable way.  
- A table allows users to view and compare multiple groups of information.

## Text
We use lists for enumerations. This means that each item should be no longer than one sentence, preferably just a few words. All items in a list should have the same form and structure.

### Punctuation rules for lists
A common mistake when writing lists is incorrect use of colons, full stops, commas, and capital letters. There are two main rules for punctuation.

1. When each item is a continuation of the introductory sentence
- do not use a colon after the introduction
- use a lower-case initial letter in each item
- do not use a full stop or comma at the end of each item

2. When each item is a complete sentence, use a colon in the introductory sentence. In addition, remember the following:
- Use a capital letter for the first word, so that each item reads as a complete sentence.
- Use a full stop at the end of each item to indicate that the sentence is complete.

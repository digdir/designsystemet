## Implementation tests

### 1. Informative badge must be included in the programmatic name (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2, 2.4.4)

- A badge that conveys important information (for example the number of unread messages) must be included in the programmatic name of the interactive element it belongs to.

### 2. Badge information must be programmatically associated with the control (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2)

- If the badge is placed outside the interactive element, the information must be programmatically associated with the control.
- Solutions where the badge is not part of the control’s programmatic name should be avoided.

### 3. Decorative badge must be hidden from screen readers (WCAG 1.1.1)

- A badge that is purely decorative must be hidden from screen readers.

### 4. Dynamically updated badge must be announced (WCAG 4.1.3)

- If a badge is updated dynamically (for example from 1 to 2), the change must be announced to screen readers in an appropriate manner.

### 5. Badge must not rely on color alone (WCAG 1.4.1)

- Information conveyed by a badge must be understandable without relying solely on color or position.
- A visual indicator (for example a red dot) alone is not sufficient.

**Use `Badge` when**
- displaying numbers that show the count of new messages, notifications or tasks
- indicating status using a circular marker, such as showing whether a person is busy, away or active

**Avoid `Badge` when**
- text is needed, use [`Tag`](/en/components/docs/tag/overview) instead
- interactive actions are required, use [`Chip`](/en/components/docs/chip/overview) or [`Button`](/en/components/docs/button/overview) instead

## Examples

### Colours and variants

All colours in your theme can be used with `Badge`. The component comes in two variants: `base` and `tinted`.

### Next to text

`Badge` can be placed next to other text or components.

<Story story="InTabs" />

### Floating

`Badge` can be placed floating above other elements.

<Story story="Floating" />

### Without text

`Badge` can be used without text inside it, but it must then have accompanying text next to it. Information should not be communicated through colour or shape alone.<sup>1</sup>

## Guidelines
Use `Badge` to draw attention to statuses, notifications or numbers.

## Text
This component is not intended for text. If you need to display words or short phrases, use [`Tag`](/en/components/docs/tag/overview) instead.

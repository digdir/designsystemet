<Story story="Preview" />

**Use `Badge` when**
- displaying numbers that show the count of new messages, notifications or tasks
- indicating status using a circular marker, such as showing whether a person is busy, away or active

**Avoid `Badge` when**
- text is needed — use [`Tag`](/no/components/tag/overview) instead
- interactive actions are required — use [`Chip`](/no/components/chip/overview) or [`Button`](/no/components/button/overview) instead

## Examples

### Next to text

Badges can be placed next to other text or components.

<Story story="InTabs" />

### Floating

Badges can be positioned floating over other elements. Note that this may affect accessibility.

<Story story="Floating" />

### Colours and variants

All colours in your theme can be used with `Badge`.  
The component comes in two variants: `base` and `tinted`.

## Guidelines
Use `Badge` to draw attention to statuses, notifications or numbers.

## Text
This component is not intended for text. If you need to display words or short phrases, use [`Tag`](/no/components/tag/overview) instead.

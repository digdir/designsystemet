```tsx
import { Badge } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

/* Inline without numbers */
<Badge />

/* Inline with numbers */
<Badge count={5} maxCount={99} />

/* Floating over element */
<Badge.Position>
<Badge />
<Elem />
</Badge.Position>
```

## Examples

### Variants

You can switch between `variant` and `data-color` to get different colors and styles.

<Story story="Variants" />

### Floating

You can set the placement with `placement`, and choose what type of `overlap` it can have.

<Story story="Floating" />

Not all icons have the same shape, and then you may have to change where the `Badge` should be placed. If you can't get the `Badge` to be where you want it, you can use `style` to override the placement.
This also works when using `overlap="circle"`.

### Inline

To have the `Badge` inline, place it directly in the text or component.

<Story story="InTabsEn" />

## HTML

`Badge` renders its text with CSS in a `:before` pseudo-element on a `span` tag.
You use the class name `ds-badge`, in conjunction with the data attribute.

If you want it to be floating, `ds-badge--position` must be used on a wrapper around the element that the `Badge` is to be placed over.
`data-placement` is used on the wrapper to determine the placement. See the bottom of the page for supported placements.
You can also set `data-overlap="circle"` on it to get circular overlap.

```html
<!-- inline without numbers -->
<span class="ds-badge"></span>

<!-- inline with numbers -->
<span class="ds-badge" data-count="9+"></span>

<!-- float over element -->
<span class="ds-badge--position" data-placement="top-right" data-overlap="circle">
<span class="ds-badge" data-count="5"></span>
<Icon />
</span>
```

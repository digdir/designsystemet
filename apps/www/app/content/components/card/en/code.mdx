## Usage

```tsx
import { Card } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Card>
  <Card.Block>Title</Card.Block>
  <Card.Block>Content</Card.Block>
  <Card.Block>Optional footer</Card.Block>
</Card>;
```

## Code examples

### Colours

Cards come in all theme colours and have two variants.

<Story story="Variants" />

### With sections

Use multiple `Card.Block` elements if you want to divide the card with separators or add images or video that extend to the edge. Note that when you use `Card.Block`, all content must be placed inside a `Card.Block` and not directly in the `Card`.

<Story story="Media" />

### Link card

`Card` can be used as a navigation card to take users to another page.

There are two ways to do this.

#### 1. Card with a link in the title

If the card should link to another page, you can place a link in the card’s title.  
The entire card then becomes clickable, but screen reader users get a [better experience than if the whole card were a link (adrianroselli.com)](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html).

In this example, `Card` renders an `<a>` inside the heading element.  
This is useful when `Card` contains text or media and should navigate to another page.

#### 2. Card as a link

The entire card can become a link by using `asChild`. This is useful when you want all text and content in the `Card` to be read by screen readers as one continuous link.

In this example, `Card` renders as `<a>`.

<Story story="AsLink" />

### Horizontal

You can switch between `display: flex` and `display: grid` to place `Card.Block` next to each other:

<Story story="AsGrid" />

## HTML

`Card` has two class names you can use.
- `ds-card`: The main class that wraps the entire card.
- `ds-card__block`: The class used for each section within the card.

```html
<!-- without sections -->
<div class="ds-card">
  A card
</div>

<!-- with sections -->
<div class="ds-card">
  <div class="ds-card__block">
    Title
  </div>
  <div class="ds-card__block">
    Content
  </div>
  <div class="ds-card__block">
    Optional footer
  </div>
</div>
```

## CSS variables and data attributes

`Card` has two CSS classes, but all CSS variables are attached to the main class `ds-card`.

## Usage

`ErrorSummary` consists of several sub-components that must be used correctly:

- `ErrorSummary.Heading` defines the heading
- `ErrorSummary.List` defines the list of errors
- Each error is represented as an `ErrorSummary.Item` containing an `ErrorSummary.Link`
- Each `ErrorSummary.Link` must have an `href` to the unique identifier for a form field, so the user can navigate to the correct location in the form

## Guidelines

- Place `ErrorSummary` at the top of the page or step where the error occurs
- Always use together with validation errors on the relevant fields
- Link to the specific fields that have errors
- Write clear and descriptive error messages

## Text

- Use a clear heading like "To proceed, you must correct the following errors:"
- Error messages should be specific and state what is wrong
- Tell the user what they need to do to fix the error

## Accessibility

When `ErrorSummary` becomes visible, this must be communicated to screen reader users.

### Move focus

It is important that `ErrorSummary` receives focus on submit so the user notices that there are errors or missing information in the form. You can use a ref to move focus:

<Story story="ShowHide" layout="column" />

### Do not use live region for ErrorSummary

`ErrorSummary` should not use live region (`aria-live`). This is because screen readers often have their own alerts when a form is submitted, and a combination of these can lead to confusing narration.

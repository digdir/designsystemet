## Usage

```tsx
import { Radio } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Radio label="Radio" value="value" name="name" />
```

## Examples

### Grouping
Use [`Fieldset`](/en/components/docs/fieldset/code) around a group of radio buttons to provide a common prompt (`<legend>`) and optionally a description (`description`).

<Story story="GroupEn" />

### With Error
Here we must use [`Fieldset`](/en/components/docs/fieldset/code), because it activates the correct style and ensures that the content has the correct connections for accessibility.

<Story story="WithErrorEn" />

### Readonly

Fields with the `readonly` attribute are included in the tab order. Users can copy the content but not edit it. Information is included when the form is submitted.

`Readonly` fields can be confusing for some users. Not everyone will understand why they cannot change the content of the field. We therefore recommend avoiding `readonly` as much as possible.

<Story story="ReadOnlyEn" />

### Inline
Radio *can* be positioned horizontally with `flex`, but should generally be [placed vertically](/en/components/docs/radio/overview#placement).
<Story story="InlineEn" />

## HTML

`Radio` is a composite component, so in HTML you have to build it from multiple components.
We use [`Fieldset`](/en/components/docs/fieldset/code), [`Label`](/en/components/docs/label/code) and [`Input`](/en/components/docs/input/code) to create a `Radio`.

The code below shows how you can visually build a `Radio` in HTML, but you have to make sure that `<input>` is connected with `<label>` and description.

```html
<div class="ds-field">
  <input
  class="ds-input"
  type="radio"
  value="value"
  name="name"
  id="my-radio"
  >
  <label
  class="ds-label"
  data-weight="regular"
  for="my-radio"
  >Radio</label>
</div>

```

### In Fieldset

The code below is an example of how to use multiple `Radio` inside `<fieldset>`.

```html
<fieldset class="ds-fieldset">
  <legend class="ds-label" data-weight="medium">Can we contact you by email?</legend>
  <p class="ds-paragraph" data-variant="default">If you do not wish to be contacted by email, we will send you a letter by post.</p>
  <div class="ds-field">
    <input
    class="ds-input"
    type="radio"
    value="yes"
    id="radio-input"
    >
    <label
    class="ds-label"
    data-weight="regular"
    for="radio-input"
    >Yes</label>
  </div>
  <div class="ds-field">
    <input
    class="ds-input"
    type="radio"
    value="no"
    id="radio-input"
    >
    <label
    class="ds-label"
    data-weight="regular"
    for="radio-input"
    >No</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

## CSS variables and data attributes
Checkbox is a composite component, and therefore we show variables and data attributes from `ds-input` here.

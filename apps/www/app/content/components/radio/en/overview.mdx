**Use `Radio` when**
- the user must choose one of several options in a form

**Avoid `Radio` when**
- the user should be able to choose more than one option; use [`Checkbox`](/docs/komponenter-checkbox--docs) instead

## Example

### Grouping

Use a [`Fieldset`](/no/components/fieldset) around a group of radio buttons to provide a shared heading (`<legend>`) and, if needed a (`<description>`).

<Story story="Group" />

### With error

Here we must use `Fieldset`, as it applies the correct styling and ensures that the elements are properly connected for accessibility.

<Story story="WithError" />

### Readonly

Fields with the `readonly` attribute remain in the tab order.  
Users can copy the content but cannot edit it. The information is included when the form is submitted.

`readonly` fields can be confusing for some users. Not everyone understands why the content cannot be changed. We therefore recommend avoiding `readonly` whenever possible.

### Inline

As a general rule, `Radio` should *not* be placed on the same line. However, if you only have two options with short labels such as “Yes” and “No”, you may consider placing them side by side.

## Guidelines

Use `Radio` when users must select only one option.  
If users should be able to select several, use [`Checkbox`](/docs/komponenter-checkbox--docs).

There should not be more than seven options in a group.  
If users need more relevant choices, consider using [`Suggestion`](/no/components/suggestion) or [`Select`](/no/components/select).  
If only one choice is required, a [`Switch`](/no/components/switch) or a [`Checkbox`](/no/components/checkbox) may be more suitable.

### Sorting

Sort answer options alphabetically unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.  
Be careful about placing the most common option first if the question is personal or value-based, such as sexual orientation or political affiliation.

### Placement

Place radio buttons vertically whenever possible.  
This makes the list easier to scan and the options easier to read.  
For users who need to zoom in, horizontal layouts can be challenging.

If there are only two options with short labels, these may be shown next to each other.  
A [Likert scale (snl.no)](https://snl.no/Likert-skala) is another example where horizontal placement is natural.

When displayed horizontally, it must be clear which text belongs to which button.  
Use horizontal placement only when there are two short options, or in rating scales such as “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”.

### Avoid pre-selected options

Consider carefully whether you truly need a pre-selected option.  
It may have the opposite effect of what you intend — for example, by making users feel influenced towards a specific choice, or preventing them from making a conscious decision.

## Text

A group with several options should always have a heading (`<legend>`) and, if needed, a description (`description`) to provide further explanation.  
The description should appear immediately after the legend and give the user the necessary information before they make a choice.

<div className="dodont-row">
  <DoDont story="DoIcon">
    Users receive all important and relevant information before making a choice.  
    This follows a logical reading order and helps them feel confident that they are choosing the correct option.
  </DoDont>
  <DoDont story="DontIcon">
    Important and relevant information appears after the choice and is less visible to users.  
    This breaks the logical reading order and may cause users to choose incorrectly.
  </DoDont>
</div>

If one or more radio buttons require a description, it should be placed directly under the corresponding answer option (`<label>`).

Answer options should be as short as possible, and each option should use the same linguistic form.

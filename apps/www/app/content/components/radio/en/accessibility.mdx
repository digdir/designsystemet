Make sure there is enough spacing around each radio button so that it is easy to select, including on touch devices.

Avoid placing radio buttons next to each other. This makes them harder to read and creates problems for users who need to zoom a webpage or app to see clearly.

### Disabled states
Avoid disabled states if possible. They have low colour contrast, which can be problematic for some users. `disabled` cannot meet contrast requirements, because if the contrast were higher, users might think the element is active, try to select it, and not understand why nothing happens. NAV has a good explanation of [why disabled states are problematic](https://aksel.nav.no/god-praksis/artikler/deaktiverte-tilstander) and what alternatives exist.

### Keyboard navigation
Note that we use the arrow keys to select options in the `Radio` component, not the Tab key.

- <kbd data-icon>↑</kbd> or <kbd data-icon>←</kbd> moves to the previous option  
- <kbd data-icon>↓</kbd> or <kbd data-icon>→</kbd> moves to the next option  
- <kbd>Space</kbd> moves to the first option in a group of radio buttons when the group does not have a preselected option  
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves to the entire group of options

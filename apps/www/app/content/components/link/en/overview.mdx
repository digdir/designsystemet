`Link` is clickable text or graphics that makes it easy for users to navigate to files or pages internally or externally.

<Story story="Preview" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Link } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Link href='https://designsystemet.no/'>Go to designsystemet</Link>;
```

## Code Examples

### In text

A link is often used as part of a text.

<Story story="InText" />

### With icon

The icon is placed on the left side. This is a functional icon that tells users where the link leads them.

<Story story="WithIcon" />

### Neutral color

<Story story="Neutral" />

## Guidelines

It's important not to overuse links, as it can make it difficult for users to find their way forward.

**Suitable for**

- navigating to another page or location in the application
- navigating to an external page
- downloading a file

**Not suitable for:**

- Performing an action not related to navigation, such as submitting a form. Then you should use a [`Button`](/docs/komponenter-button--docs)).

## Accessibility

`Link` functions as `<a>`, and no functionality has been changed. When the user has visited a link previously, the color of the link will change.

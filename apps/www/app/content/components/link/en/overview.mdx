<Story story="Preview" />

**Use `Link` when**
- the user needs to navigate to another page within the solution
- the navigation leads to an external website
- a file should be downloaded

**Avoid `Link` when**
- the purpose is not navigation; use a [`Button`](/no/components/button/overview) instead
- the action changes the state of the solution, such as opening a dialog, starting a process or saving data

## Example

### In text

A link is often used as part of a text.

<Story story="InText" />

### With icon

The icon is placed on the left. This is a functional icon that helps users understand where the link will take them.

<Story story="WithIcon" />

### Neutral colour

<Story story="Neutral" />

## Guidelines

It is important not to overuse links, as this can make it harder for users to find their way forward.

### Opening links in a new tab/window

Both internal and external links should open in the same tab/window.  
This ensures a predictable user experience by respecting the user’s own browser settings for how links should open. Read more about this in the article [Labelling links](https://www.designsystemet.no/no/patterns/external-links).

## Text

The article [Labelling links](https://www.designsystemet.no/no/patterns/external-links#spr%C3%A5k) contains guidelines for how to write link text. It is important that link text is descriptive and gives users a clear indication of what to expect when they activate the link.

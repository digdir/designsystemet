<Story story="PreviewEn" />

**Use `Tooltip` when**
* a symbol needs a brief explanation  
* the action of an interactive element needs to be clarified  
* keyboard shortcuts need to be shown  

**Avoid using `Tooltip` when**
* the text is already visible on the page  
* the explanation is longer than four words, use [`Popover`](/en/components/docs/popover/overview) instead
* the content contains links or other interactive elements, use [`Popover`](/en/components/docs/popover/overview) instead  

## Example

### With text

<Story story="WithStringEn" />

### Placement
Consider whether the `Tooltip` should be placed above, below, or beside the element.

<Story story="PlacementEn" />

## Guidelines
`Tooltip` provides brief supplementary information without distracting from the main content. It is not intended for information that is essential for completing a task. Important content should instead appear as body text or help text on the page.

If richer content is needed - for example longer text, images, or buttons - use a [`Popover`](/en/components/docs/popover/overview) instead.

`Tooltip` should never be used as a replacement for `alt` text or `title`.

## Text
A `Tooltip` should not contain more than one sentence or more than four words, to avoid obstructing other important elements on the screen.

`Tooltip` should not repeat text that is already present on the page. It should provide additional help or clarification that is not immediately obvious.

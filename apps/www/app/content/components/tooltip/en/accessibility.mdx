### Mouse interaction
The `Tooltip` appears when you hover the mouse pointer over an element, and disappears when the pointer moves away.

### Keyboard interaction
The `Tooltip` appears when an element receives keyboard focus, and disappears when the focus is removed.

### Touch interaction
On touch devices, `Tooltip` is less suitable because it is normally triggered by `hover` or `focus`, which are not supported on these devices. Instead, the `Tooltip` appears only when the user taps the element, and disappears again when the user taps outside the element.

## Known limitations

In Safari, the fade-in animation does not work.

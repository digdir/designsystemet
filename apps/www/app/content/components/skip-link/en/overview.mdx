**Use `SkipLink` when**
- there are several tab stops before reaching the main content  
- users need a way to skip repeated elements such as menus, links, or headers

**Avoid `SkipLink` when**
- the page has only a few tab stops before the main content  
- the website consists of a single page without repeated content  

## Guidelines
`SkipLink` should be one of the first elements the keyboard focus reaches when navigating with the keyboard.

When navigating with a keyboard, users must be able to skip content that appears on multiple pages, such as menus, links, and the page header. `SkipLink` helps users move quickly to the main content.

If there are only a few tab stops before the main content — for example, if the page only contains a single “Home” link at the top — adding a `SkipLink` may be unnecessary. In such cases, it could introduce more focusable elements than needed.

Place `SkipLink` as the first focusable element on the page. If the page includes a cookie banner or similar message, place the `SkipLink` immediately after that element in the code.

`SkipLink` should visually stand out from the rest of the content when focused, so users who can see but navigate with a keyboard can easily recognise it before moving on.

## Text
Make sure the text clearly describes what the shortcut does. Use simple and direct wording, such as “Skip to main content”.

</Alert>

`SkipLink` is usually not visible until a keyboard press activates it.

Be aware that some automated accessibility tests may warn that a `SkipLink` is missing from a landmark, such as a `<nav>`. This warning does not apply to `SkipLink`, so you can safely ignore it.

Make sure that `SkipLink` behaves predictably. A `SkipLink` with the text “Skip to content” should move the user’s focus to the start of the content, not to the beginning of the first paragraph under the heading.

### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd>Enter</kbd> follows the link and jumps to the target

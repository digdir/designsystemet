## Usage
`Field` can be used with `Input`, `Textarea` and `Select`. **NOTE**: `Textfield` already has `Field` built in, and therefore cannot be used in a `Field`.

```tsx
<Field>
<Label>Short description</Label>
<Field.Description>Description</Field.Description>
<Input />
<ValidationMessage>Error message</ValidationMessage>
</Field>
```

## Examples

### Prefix/Suffix

Prefixes and suffixes are useful for displaying units, currency or other types of information relevant to the field. You should **not** use these on their own, as screen readers do not read them out. It is important that the same information displayed in the prefix or suffix is ​​also included in the prompt.

<Story story="AffixEn" />

### Number of characters

Use `Field.Counter` to inform about the number of characters users can type in the field.

<Story story="CounterEn" />

### Position

Use `position="end"` when you want to place, for example, a `Switch` to the right of `Label`.

You can change the text by submitting props, which you can see at the top of the page. The language is standard Norwegian Bokmål.

<Story story="PositionEn" layout="column" />

## HTML

You can get styling from `Field` with the class name `ds-field`.
On the description you must set `data-field="description"` to get correct styling.

Also, there is some javascript that `Field` runs internally, so this must be connected yourself.

The code we use is not react-specific, so you can copy our code until we have a better alternative outside of React.

[`fieldObserver` (github.com)](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/blob/main/packages/react/src/components/field/field-observer.ts)

```html
<div class="ds-field">
  <label
  class="ds-label"
  data-weight="medium"
  for="field-input"
  >Last name</label>
  <div data-field="description" id="field-description">Last name cannot contain spaces</div>
  <input
  class="ds-input"
  type="text"
  value="Nordic Swedish"
  id="field-input"
  aria-describedby="field-error field-description"
  >
  <p
  class="ds-validation-message"
  data-field="validation"
  id="field-error"
  >You cannot have spaces in your last name</p>
</div>

```

**Make sure the form field has `aria-describedby` which refers to both description and validation message.**.
Error should be placed first in `aria-describedby` so that screen readers read the error message first.

`data-field="validation"` is only needed if you connect `fieldObserver`.

### Position

To change the position of elements in `Field`, such as a `Switch`, you can add `data-position="end|start"` to the same element as `ds-field`.

```html
<div class="ds-field" data-position="end">
  <label
  class="ds-label"
  data-weight="medium"
  for=":mhxbylqzlb8"
  >Flightmode</label>
  <input
  class="ds-input"
  role="switch"
  type="checkbox"
  id=":mhxbylqzlb8"
  >
</div>
```

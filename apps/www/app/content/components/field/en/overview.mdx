**Use `Field` when**
- you need to ensure that [`Label`](/en/components/docs/label/overview), `Field.Description`, [`ValidationMessage`](/en/components/docs/validation-message/overview) and `Field.Counter` are correctly associated with a field

**Avoid `Field` when**
- you need to semantically group multiple fields; use [`Fieldset`](/en/components/docs/fieldset/overview) instead

## Example

### Prefix/Suffix

Prefixes and suffixes are useful for showing units, currency or other types of information relevant to the field. You should **not** use these on their own, as screen readers do not announce them.  It is important that the same information shown in the prefix or suffix is also included in the label.

### Character count

Use `Field.Counter` to inform users about the number of characters they can enter in the field.

### Placement

You can change the placement (`start/end`) of certain elements within `Field`, such as a `Switch`. This can be useful in settings interfaces, where the user should first read the label on the left — explaining what the setting applies to — and then the action element (the switch) on the right.

## Guidelines

`Field` helps you structure form fields in an accessible and consistent way. It automatically links [`Label`](/en/components/docs/label/overview), `Field.Description`, [`ValidationMessage`](/en/components/docs/validation-message/overview) and `Field.Counter` to the relevant field using the correct ARIA attributes.

## Known issues

VoiceOver may sometimes read `Field.Counter` twice when it is placed inside an iframe. See the [bug report on apple.com](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256085771?sortBy=rank).

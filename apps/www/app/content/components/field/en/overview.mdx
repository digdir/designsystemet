<Story story="Preview" />

**Use `Field` when**
- you need to ensure that [`Label`](/en/components/docs/label/overview), `Field.Description`, [`ValidationMessage`](/en/components/docs/validation-message/overview) and `Field.Counter` are correctly associated with a field

**Avoid `Field` when**
- you need to semantically group multiple fields; use [`Fieldset`](/en/components/docs/fieldset/overview) instead

## Example

### Prefix/Suffix

Prefixes and suffixes are useful for showing units, currency or other types of information relevant to the field. You should **not** use these on their own, as screen readers do not announce them.  It is important that the same information shown in the prefix or suffix is also included in the label.

### Character count

Use `Field.Counter` to inform users about the number of characters they can enter in the field.

### Placement
When you use `Field` together with choice components such as `Switch`, you can place the label either before or after the control. This makes it easy to adapt the component to the context.

## Guidelines

`Field` helps you structure form fields in an accessible and consistent way. It automatically links [`Label`](/en/components/docs/label/overview), `Field.Description`, [`ValidationMessage`](/en/components/docs/validation-message/overview) and `Field.Counter` to the relevant field using the correct ARIA attributes.

**Use `Dialog` when** 
- the user needs to focus on a specific task
- you need to ensure that the user notices important information

**Avoid `Dialog` when**
- the content is extensive or complex
- the process contains several steps
- interrupting the user’s workflow may be problematic, use [`Alert`](/en/components/docs/alert/overview), [`Popover`](/en/components/docs/popover/overview) or a non-modal `Dialog` instead

## Example

### With blocks

`Dialog` can be divided with visual separators to keep the content clearly structured.

<Story story="WithBlocks" />

### With form

When a `Dialog` contains form elements, it is helpful to move focus directly to the first field, unless other important content should be read first.

<Story story="WithFormEn" />

## Guidelines

Use `Dialog` to present important content that requires the user’s attention or action. We avoid calling the component “modal”, since it can also function as non-modal.

`Dialog` can be used as both **modal** and **non-modal**.

### Modal Dialog
A modal `Dialog` is a temporary window that opens above the rest of the page. It captures the user’s attention and prevents interaction with other content, while still preserving the context of the page.

Use of modal `Dialog` should generally be limited, but it can be helpful when the user must consider information, confirm an action, or focus on a specific task without navigating away from the page.

### Non-modal Dialog
A non-modal `Dialog` allows the user to continue interacting with the rest of the page while the dialog is open. It should be used with care and is most suitable for providing supplementary information or extra functionality that does not require full attention.

## Text
- Use a short and concise heading. The heading must make it clear to the user that the context has changed.  
- Avoid long blocks of text.  
- Ensure that the purpose is clear and that all necessary information is available within the dialog.

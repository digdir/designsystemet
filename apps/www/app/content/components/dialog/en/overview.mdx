**Use a modal `Dialog` when**
- users need to confirm a critical action, such as deleting something that cannot be undone
- users must see a specific dialog and are required to respond to it
- you need to ensure that users notice important information

**Avoid a modal `Dialog` when**
- the content is extensive or complex
- the content is one of several steps in a process
- you need to notify users about something that does not require action. Use [`Alert`](/no/components/docs/alert/overview) or a non-modal `Dialog` instead
- you want to provide brief information that users can choose whether to view. Use [`Popover`](/no/components/docs/popover/overview)

See also the [system notifications pattern](/en/patterns/systemnotifications#when-do-we-use-modals) for more information about when a modal `Dialog` should be used.

<Card data-color="info">
  Many refer to this component simply as a modal. In Designsystemet, we use `Dialog`, which is based on the built-in HTML `<dialog>` element, and distinguish between modal and non-modal dialogs based on how they behave.

## Example

### With blocks

`Dialog` can be divided with visual separators to keep the content clearly structured.

<Story story="WithBlocks" />

### With form

When a `Dialog` contains form elements, it is helpful to move focus directly to the first field, unless other important content should be read first.

<Story story="WithFormEn" />

### Placement

With `placement`, `Dialog` will behave like a so-called "drawer" from the position you specify.
<Story story="Drawer" layout="block" />

## Guidelines

Use `Dialog` to present important content that requires the user’s attention or action. We avoid calling the component “modal”, since it can also function as non-modal.

`Dialog` can be used as both **modal** and **non-modal**.

### Modal Dialog
A modal `Dialog` is a temporary window that opens above the rest of the page. It captures the user’s attention and prevents interaction with other content, while still preserving the context of the page.

Use of modal `Dialog` should generally be limited, but it can be helpful when the user must consider information, confirm an action, or focus on a specific task without navigating away from the page.

### Non-modal Dialog
A non-modal `Dialog` allows the user to continue interacting with the rest of the page while the dialog is open. It should be used with care and is most suitable for providing supplementary information or extra functionality that does not require full attention.

### Closing a `Dialog`
Ensure that users always have a clear and simple way to close a `Dialog`. The most common solution is a close button (X) in the top right corner. It must remain visible even when the dialog contains a lot of content and scrolling is required.

If placing a close button (X) in the top right corner is not appropriate, the dialog must include a clear close action within the content, for example a Cancel button. This gives users control and prevents them from getting stuck in the dialog.


## Text
- Use a short and concise heading. The heading must make it clear to the user that the context has changed.  
- Avoid long blocks of text.  
- Ensure that the purpose is clear and that all necessary information is available within the dialog.

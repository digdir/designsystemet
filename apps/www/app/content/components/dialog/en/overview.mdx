**Use a modal `Dialog` when**
- users need to confirm a critical action, such as deleting something that cannot be undone  
- users must see a specific dialog and are required to respond to it  
- you need to ensure that users notice important information  

**Avoid using a modal `Dialog` when**
- the content is extensive or complex  
- the content is one of several steps in a process  
- you need to notify users about something that does not require action. Use [`Alert`](/en/components/docs/alert/overview) or a non-modal `Dialog` instead  
- you want to provide short, optional information, use [`Popover`](/en/components/docs/popover/overview)  

See also the [system notifications pattern](/en/patterns/systemnotifications#when-do-we-use-modals) for more guidance on when a modal `Dialog` should be used.

<Card data-color="info">
  Many people refer to this component simply as a “modal”. In Designsystemet, we use `Dialog`, which is based on the native HTML `<dialog>` element, and distinguish between [modal and non-modal dialogs (nngroup.com)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/) based on how they behave.

## Examples

### Modal `Dialog`
An example of a modal dialog that requires users to make a decision before they can continue using the page.

### Non-modal `Dialog`
Non-modal dialogs are useful when users should be able to continue working while the dialog remains open.  
[Note: Make sure that elements receiving focus are not hidden behind the dialog](accessibility#non-modal-dialogs).

### `Dialog` as a drawer
Using `placement`, `Dialog` can behave like a so-called “drawer” from the position you specify.

## Guidelines
Limit the use of `Dialog` as it breaks the flow and interrupts users. Do not interrupt users unless it is necessary. Interruptions disrupt the workflow and should only be used when the content is important enough or can prevent users from making mistakes. Users may not understand why the dialog appears, how to close it, or whether they need to take action. This is particularly challenging for users with concentration difficulties, low vision, or those using screen readers.

### Closing a `Dialog`
Always ensure that users have a visible and simple way to close a `Dialog`. The most common approach is a close button (X) in the top right corner. It should remain visible even when the dialog contains a lot of content and the user needs to scroll. If this is not suitable, provide another way to close the dialog, such as a Cancel button.

Carefully consider whether the dialog can be closed by clicking outside it. For critical choices, users should close the dialog through an explicit action.

When users close the dialog without making an active choice, this should correspond to the least critical or least destructive option.

## Text
The heading should clearly indicate that users need to take action. Using a question as the heading can be effective.

The content should be brief, while still providing the information users need to make a decision. Use buttons to give users a clear path forward.

Make it clear what will happen when users choose an option, especially if the action cannot be undone.

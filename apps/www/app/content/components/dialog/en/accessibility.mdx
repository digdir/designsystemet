### Non-modal dialogs
When using non-modal dialogs, you must ensure that elements receiving focus through keyboard navigation do not end up behind the dialog and become hidden. See criteria [2.4.11 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html) (AA) and [2.4.12 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html) (AAA).

For non-modal dialogs, this means you must:
- Ensure that focusable elements are never completely covered by the dialog when users navigate the page using the Tab key.
- Ensure that the focus order is logical and that focus is always visible, so users navigating with a keyboard or screen reader can understand where focus is located.


### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd>Esc</kbd> closes the dialog (focus returns to the trigger)

**Use `Spinner` when**
- you need to indicate that the system is working on a task the user must wait for  
- a local action is being performed, such as submitting a form or updating a table  
- loading will take more than one second

**Avoid `Spinner` when**
- only specific parts of the page are loading — consider using [`Skeleton`](/en/components/docs/skeleton/overview) instead  
- loading takes less than one second

## Example

### Sizes

You can adjust the size of the `Spinner` depending on where it is placed.

## Guidelines

The purpose of `Spinner` is to reassure the user that the system is working and has not stopped. It can be used in a button, a field, or another defined area where the user is waiting for something to happen, such as saving or updating content.

## Text

In some cases, it may improve the user experience to show explanatory text alongside the `Spinner`, describing why the user has to wait. A clear explanation helps reduce uncertainty and confusion.

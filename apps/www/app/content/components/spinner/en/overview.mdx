`Spinner` is used to indicate that content or an action is loading, and that the user must wait before they can continue.

<Story story="Preview" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Spinner } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Spinner aria-label="Loading" />
```

## Code Examples

### Sizes

You can adjust the size of `Spinner` based on where it should be placed.

<Story story="Sizes" />

## Guidelines

The purpose of `Spinner` is to provide visual confirmation that the system is working, thereby creating confidence that the process hasn't stopped.

**Suitable for**

- indicating that the system is working on a task the user must wait for
- local actions, such as submitting a form or updating a table
- telling the user when loading will take more than 1 second

**Not suitable for**

- showing that individual elements on the page are being loaded (consider [Skeleton](/docs/komponenter-loaders-skeleton--docs) instead)
- when loading takes less than 1 second

## Accessibility

To ensure a good user experience, `Spinner` should be combined with text or have an `aria-label`, so that users with assistive technologies also get information that loading is in progress.

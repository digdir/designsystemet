`Divider` is a purely visual element, and it is not announced by screen readers.

However, avoid using a `Divider` solely for visual effect without functional meaning. A `Divider` represents a thematic separation of content. To communicate this separation in an accessible way, you must also use elements that a screen reader can interpret. This can include a [`Heading`](en/components/docs/heading/overview), a [`List`](en/components/docs/list/overview), [`<section>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section), or elements with [`role="group"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role).

Use the component to mark a boundary between content that is not logically connected, such as different sections in an article or different functional areas on a page. Use it to visually clarify the structure, not simply to fill empty space or “decorate” the page.

`Divider` is used to create a visual separation between content. It is a simple horizontal line that extends across the available width.

<Story story="Preview" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Divider } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Divider />
```

## Guidelines

`Divider` is used to break content into smaller parts, making it more organized and easier to read. It can also be used to separate related content that still needs a visual distinction.

**Suitable when**

- you want to create a clear division of content
- you want to structure content visually for better readability
- whitespace alone doesn't provide sufficient separation

**Not suitable when**

- natural spacing or other visual elements provide sufficient separation
- too many `Divider` elements create a cluttered visual appearance

## Accessibility

`Divider` is a purely visual tool and is not read by screen readers.

However, avoid using `Divider` solely for visual effect without functional significance. A `Divider` represents a thematic division of content. To communicate this division in an accessible way, you must also use elements that a screen reader understands. This can be, for example, a [`Heading`](/docs/komponenter-heading--docs), a [`List`](/docs/komponenter-list--docs), [`<section>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section), or elements with [`role="group"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role).

The component should be used to mark a separation between content that doesn't logically belong together, such as different sections in an article or different functional areas on a page. Use it to visually clarify the structure, not just to fill empty space or "decorate" the page.

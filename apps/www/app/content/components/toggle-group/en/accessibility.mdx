## Implementation tests

### 1. Each segment must have a clear programmatic name (WCAG 1.1.1, 4.1.2)

- Each button in a ToggleGroup must have a self-explanatory programmatic name.
- If a button displays only an icon, it must have a programmatic name that describes the action.

### 2. ToggleGroup must have a clear programmatic name (WCAG 4.1.2, 2.4.6)

- The ToggleGroup must have a programmatic name that describes what the options relate to.
- The name may be a visible label or programmatically associated text.

### 3. ToggleGroup must function on small screens (WCAG 1.4.10)

- The ToggleGroup must be usable at narrow viewports without content disappearing or becoming inaccessible.
- The entire component must be visible without horizontal scrolling.

---

## Good practice

- If the ToggleGroup uses icons only, a tooltip should also be provided to visually clarify the action.
- A tooltip does not replace the requirement for a programmatic name.


`ToggleGroup` uses the standard focus indicator (outline).  
We use `roving tabindex` to manage focus movement between the buttons.

### Keyboard interaction

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves focus to the active toggle button.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> moves focus to the element before the `ToggleGroup` in the tabindex.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> selects a button.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> selects a button.
- <kbd data-icon>↑</kbd> moves focus to the previous button in the group.
- <kbd data-icon>←</kbd> moves focus to the previous button in the group.
- <kbd data-icon>↓</kbd> moves focus to the next button in the group.
- <kbd data-icon>→</kbd> moves focus to the next button in the group.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves to the first button in the group.
- <kbd>End</kbd> moves to the last button in the group.

### Keyboard navigation
* <kbd data-icon>←</kbd>/<kbd data-icon>→</kbd> moves to the previous/next option (single select)
* <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> activates/toggles the selected option

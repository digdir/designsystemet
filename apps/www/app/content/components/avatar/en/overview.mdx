**Use `Avatar` when**
- representing a person or an entity.

**Avoid `Avatar` when**
- representing anything other than a person or an entity, such as a document. Use icons or other visual symbols instead
- it is used purely for decoration without function or meaning

## Example

### Colours

<Story story="ColorVariants" />

### Variants

<Story story="ShapeVariants" />

## Guidelines
`Avatar` should help make the user interface more recognisable and easier to navigate without distracting or taking up unnecessary space.

- Use the same avatar shape consistently throughout the solution.
- The avatar should usually be combined with text, unless it is entirely clear who or what it represents.
- Only use an avatar when it actually adds value to the user experience, for example to show who authored something or who is responsible.

## Text
`Avatar` should not contain text inside the component, except when using initials. Other text, such as full names, roles or organisations, should be placed outside the avatar to ensure good readability.

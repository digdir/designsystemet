## Implementation tests

### 1. Informative avatar must have a programmatic name (WCAG 1.1.1, 1.3.1)

- An avatar that represents an identity must have a programmatic name that corresponds to that identity.
- If multiple avatars are displayed together, each informative avatar must have a unique programmatic name.

### 2. Decorative avatar must be hidden from screen readers (WCAG 1.1.1)

- An avatar that does not convey unique information must be hidden from screen readers.

### 3. Clickable avatar must have a clear programmatic name (WCAG 4.1.2, 2.4.4)

- A clickable avatar must have a programmatic name that clearly describes the action.

### 4. Clickable avatar with initials must support voice control (WCAG 2.5.3 – to be clarified)

- If a clickable avatar visually displays initials, those initials should be included in the programmatic name.

## How to describe `Avatar` for screen readers

`Avatar` must either have an `aria-label` that describes who or what the avatar represents, or be set to `aria-hidden` with visible text conveying the same information. Do not state in the `aria-label` that it is an image - screen readers announce this automatically. It is sufficient to use the name, for example `aria-label="Ola Nordmann"`.

Images and other `children` are automatically given `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent information from being repeated.

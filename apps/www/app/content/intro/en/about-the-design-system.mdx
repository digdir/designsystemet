Designsystemet is a [digital public good](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/designsystemet) and is free to use for both public and private organisations. It is developed to make it easier to create accessible, consistent and user friendly digital services. It can be used together with an organisation’s own visual identity, so services can still have a unique expression.

## Why a shared design system?
More than 1 million people in Norway struggle to use digital services. One reason is that components and interaction patterns behave differently across services. We want to make it easier to create accessible, consistent, and user-friendly services across the public sector. We achieve this by sharing guidelines, interaction patterns, and basic components that can be used alongside each organization’s visual identity. The goal of Designsystemet is not that all services should look exactly the same, but that components should behave the same—for example, in screen readers and assistive technologies. This promotes recognizable and predictable interactions, even across visually distinct services.

Three key reasons for having a shared design system:

1. **Coherent services across sectors**  
By collaborating on a shared design system, we can provide more consistent, accessible, and recognizable user experiences across government services. The Norwegian government aims for _“public digital services to have user-friendly and consistent design across agencies, so that citizens with low digital skills can use them”._ <sup>1</sup>

2. **Less duplicated work**  
Instead of creating the same foundational components repeatedly, we can build them properly once—with high quality, accessibility, and testing in place. Best of all, we only have one place to maintain them as technologies, standards, and needs evolve. This leads to more efficient use of resources in the public sector and sustainable development. It also means more time to solve more important problems for our users.

3. **Accessibility by default**  
By providing components that meet accessibility standards—along with WCAG-aligned guidance—we make it easier for everyone to build inclusive services. Universal design often requires detailed technical and design decisions. Components may need specific HTML and ARIA attributes, correct focus handling, and screen reader announcements. On top of that, developers must account for how different browsers and screen readers interpret these combinations. These are complex challenges no one should solve alone. When we solve them together, everyone can benefit. Any bugs or improvements are shared with all who use Designsystemet.

## What does Designsystemet solve?
Designsystemet provides a shared foundation, but we know every service has its own needs. The goal is not to cover everything—but to offer flexible building blocks that work across services and agencies. When something more specialized is needed, each organization can build it themselves or extend the system.

Designsystemet is made to work with your own visual identity and specific service needs. It offers a shared structure for design and development—while allowing local customization.

By reusing common building blocks, we avoid solving the same problems over and over again. This saves time, strengthens quality, and frees up resources to address more specialized challenges.

## What does Designsystemet include?

Designsystemet consists of multiple building blocks and tools. You can use what you need, to the extent it makes sense for you:

- **Design Tokens**  
  Design Tokens are variables for colors, typography, spacing, sizes, and shapes. They are theme-based, meaning they reflect your brand via the preferences you set in the [Theme Builder](/en/fundamentals/start-here/own-theme). The color system ensures text and background always have sufficient contrast—no matter your brand colors. Token structure supports multiple themes and modes (light, dark, contrast, etc.). Tokens keep design and code in sync—this is where the magic happens.

- **UI components**  
  Designsystemet offers essential components worth sharing across services. They are available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet), [CSS](/en/fundamentals/code/css), [React](/en/fundamentals/code/react), and can also be used together with [other frameworks](/no/fundamentals/code/other-frameworks). Usage guidelines are included and continuously updated as we learn more.

- **Theme Builder**  
  The [Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no/en) helps you customize Designsystemet to match your organization’s brand. After configuration, you copy a code snippet and paste it into your terminal. In just minutes, all components reflect your brand colors.

- **Command-line interface (CLI)**  
  The [CLI](/en/fundamentals/code/cli-config) helps you set up new projects, generate structure, configure themes, and install dependencies.

- **Patterns and best practices**  
  Designsystemet is also a collaboration space for developing shared [patterns](/en/patterns) and [recommendations](/en/best-practices). Patterns include layout, navigation, error handling, and repeated user tasks. We can collaborate on patterns even if we don’t use the same tools or technologies.
  

## Who can use Designsystemet?

Anyone building digital services can use Designsystemet. It’s open source, and we welcome your help to make it better. [Let us know](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new/choose) if you find a bug or have a suggestion. You can also ask questions in our Slack channel, help others, and share your experiences there. See how to [join the Community here](/en/intro/join-the-community).

## Who uses Designsystemet today?

Designsystemet is integrated into [Altinn Studio](https://altinn.studio/), used by over 70 agencies to build digital services. If you’re building services in Altinn Studio, you’re already using components from Designsystemet.

Several other organizations also use Designsystemet in their services:

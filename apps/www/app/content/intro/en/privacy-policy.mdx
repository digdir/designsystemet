This privacy policy relates to the processing of personal data on the website designsystemet.no. You can read more about how Digdir processes personal data [here](https://www.digdir.no/digdir/personvernerklaering/706).

We use cookies to improve the user experience when you visit our website and to ensure that designsystemet.no functions properly from a technical perspective. You can choose whether to accept or reject optional cookies.

## Necessary cookies
The website uses some necessary cookies that cannot be switched off, as they are required for the site to function properly:

- **designsystemet-consent**  
Used to remember the cookie consent you have given or declined on designsystemet.no. The version helps us determine whether we need to display the banner again if new cookies have been introduced since you last gave your consent. Stored until we request renewed consent after 365 days.

- **react-router-scroll-positions**  
Designsystemet.no uses React as a tool to build web pages and handle user choices and clicks. `react-router-scroll-positions` is used to remember the position on the page where the user was when navigating between pages.

## Optional cookies
Optional cookies are only activated if you provide consent. If you choose “Accept all”, we use the analytics tool Siteimprove to collect anonymised usage statistics. This information is used to improve our services and better understand users’ needs.

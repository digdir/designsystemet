## Join the Designsystemet community

Designsystemet is shaped through collaboration across organisations. To succeed with a shared design system, we need a shared place to talk, ask questions, and explore needs and solutions together.

The easiest way to join the community is through our open Slack.

## How you can contribute

There is no single required way to contribute. If you have a need, a question, or an idea, reach out on Slack and we will explore it together.

### Suggest a new component

If you want to propose a new component, we appreciate it if you register it as a discussion on GitHub:

[Propose a new component](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/new?category=components)

When a new component is proposed, we assess whether it provides enough shared value to be part of Designsystemet. We want to avoid ending up with many components that differ only slightly, as this can lead to unnecessary complexity, maintenance effort, and design and technical debt.

For new components, we consider:

- Whether similar needs exist across other product teams or organisations. How many products or agencies would benefit?
- The problem the component solves and the value it provides.
- Whether it can be made flexible and reusable enough.
- Whether it aligns with our design principles and fits into the overall system.

### Report issues or gaps in Figma

If you find an issue with an existing component in Figma, you can:

- leave a comment directly in Figma on the relevant component, or
- create a bug report or feature request on GitHub:

[Report a bug](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+bug&projects=&template=1bug_report.yml)  
[Request a feature](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%E2%9C%A8feature+request%2Cneeds+prioritization%E2%9D%97%EF%B8%8F&projects=&template=2feature_request.yml)

### Contribute with code

If you want to contribute with code, our contributing guide explains how to get started and how we work:

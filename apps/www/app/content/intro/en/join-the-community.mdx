Designsystemet aims to foster an active and inclusive community where everyone is welcome to contribute, share experiences, and learn from one another. The goal is to create an environment where designers and developers can discuss challenges, share solutions, and help improve Designsystemet together.

Join the community to stay informed about updates and receive invitations to events and demos. The easiest way to take part is through our open Slack. More than 230 organisations and over 1,100 people have already joined.

## Who is this for?

The community is open to everyone working with digital services, whether you:

- use Designsystemet today
- are considering adopting it
- are curious and want to learn more
- want to contribute with feedback, content, or code

You are welcome whether you are a designer, developer, product manager, researcher, accessibility specialist, or advisor.

We support design systems in general and hope Slack will be a place for knowledge sharing and a strong professional community across organisations. Together, we strengthen expertise in design systems and accessibility.

## Why join?

By joining the community, you can:

- receive invitations to demos, events, and other meet-ups
- ask questions and get help when getting started
- share experiences and learn from others
- discuss best ways to solve common challenges
- provide feedback on components, patterns, and guidelines
- raise needs that affect multiple organisations
- share ideas and suggest improvements

## How you can contribute

There is no single required way to contribute. If you have a need, question, or idea, reach out on [Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack) and we will explore it together.

### Contribute with code

If you want to contribute with code, the contributing guide explains how to get started and how we work:

[Read the contributing guide](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Propose a new component

If you want to propose a new component, please register it as a discussion on GitHub. [Propose a new component](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/new?category=components) or [view existing proposals](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/components?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3AComponents+sort%3Atop).

When a new component is proposed, we assess whether it provides enough shared value to become part of Designsystemet. We want to avoid many components with only minor differences, as this can lead to unnecessary complexity.

For new components, we consider:

- whether similar needs exist across other product teams or organisations, and how many would benefit
- the problem the component solves and the value it provides
- whether it can be made flexible and reusable enough
- whether it aligns with the design principles and fits into the overall system

### Report issues or gaps in Figma

If you find an issue or weakness in an existing component in Figma, you can let us know on Slack or create an issue on GitHub.

[Report a bug](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+bug&projects=&template=1bug_report.yml) or [request an improvement](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%E2%9C%A8feature+request%2Cneeds+prioritization%E2%9D%97%EF%B8%8F&projects=&template=2feature_request.yml).

### Share your experiences

Do you have experiences you would like to share? This could be anything from how you adopted Designsystemet, to how you solved a component challenge, worked with accessibility, user testing, or gathered insights. You can write a blog post or contribute an article to the **Best practices** section.

Designsystemet is more than a set of components and guidelines. It is a collaboration arena where we agree on how user experiences across the public sector should work, and where we continuously improve them together. It also provides an open space to discuss accessibility, rather than having these discussions take place in isolation within individual organisations.

## Organisation and levels of collaboration
Designsystemet is established as a product within [Digdir](https://digdir.no) under the product group [Portals and user experience](https://baksia.digdir.no/produktgrupper/portaler-og-brukeropplevelse/).

Designsystemet collaborates across several levels:

### 1. Product council
Designsystemet has an associated product council with representatives from 13 organisations at a strategic level. The council helps set the overall direction for Designsystemet.

### 2. Cross-agency development team
The development team consists of designers and developers from Digdir, Brønnøysundregistrene, Mattilsynet, Utdanningsdirektoratet, and KS Digital. We hold planning meetings, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and necessary working sessions around specific challenges. Designers and developers work closely together.

We operate with an open [GitHub repository](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet), [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3), [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/30), and [discussion threads](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions), and aim to be as transparent and open as possible.

We want to strengthen this collaboration further. It may be relevant for your organisation to contribute a resource to the core team. We would love to hear from you. [Get in touch by email](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no).

### 3. Cross-agency pattern collaboration
In addition to the development team, we run a cross-agency collaboration focused on establishing shared patterns across public services. This work is important for creating more coherent and consistent user experiences, and is also one of the measures in the *Action plan for increased inclusion in a digital society* (measure 26), which calls for more consistent interaction patterns across services.

Design system teams from Digdir, Nav, Skatteetaten, Brønnøysundregistrene, Oslo Municipality, the Police, and Entur are among those participating. We gather insights from our respective organisations, review and compare approaches, identify differences, and agree on shared solutions through regular working sessions. The work results in articles and recommendations published on the [Patterns pages](https://www.designsystemet.no/en/patterns).

### 4. Community
Designsystemet aims to foster an active and inclusive community where anyone who wants to can contribute, share experiences, and learn from one another. The goal is to create an environment where designers and developers can discuss challenges, share solutions, and help improve Designsystemet. See how you can [join the community here](/en/intro/join-the-community).

Designsystemet is also registered as a digital public good in the [DPG registry](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/designsystemet). This means that Designsystemet has been assessed by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), is relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and meets the requirements for openness and reusability. As a result, Designsystemet can be reused and further developed by anyone.


## Values
Our values — openness, quality, coherence, and trust — guide our work.

  <Details>
    <DetailsSummary>Openness</DetailsSummary>
    <DetailsContent>
Designsystemet is built on a philosophy of collaboration. It is developed openly and in cooperation between public and private actors. Openness is a guiding principle in everything we do. By sharing work in progress, including unfinished work, we move forward together. It should be easy for anyone to contribute and provide input through open discussions, and the threshold for making changes should be low when proposals lead to better solutions. Open collaboration helps avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and enables reuse, contributing to more sustainable development of digital services.

  </Details>

  <Details>
    <DetailsSummary>Quality</DetailsSummary>
    <DetailsContent>
Designsystemet aims for high quality and to make it efficient to build high-quality digital products. Quality means both a good user experience and a solid technical foundation. All components must meet legal requirements, such as accessibility. These requirements are a minimum baseline. We aim to go further by creating accessible solutions that work as well as possible for everyone. When solutions work well for people with disabilities, the experience improves for all users.

  <Details>
    <DetailsSummary>Coherence</DetailsSummary>
    <DetailsContent>
The goal is for Designsystemet to contribute to coherent and consistent user experiences across services and organisations. Shared building blocks and recognisable patterns provide predictability and more intuitive solutions, while also helping reduce digital exclusion. Designsystemet allows for different visual identities, while promoting consistent behaviour of components and interaction patterns for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
    </DetailsContent>
  </Details>

  <Details>
    <DetailsSummary>Trust</DetailsSummary>
    <DetailsContent>
Designsystemet should handle change and challenges in a safe and predictable way to build trust among its users. Components should be stable and behave as expected. Users should be confident that Designsystemet is well managed and kept up to date in line with new requirements and needs. We aim for mutual trust, where trust in contributors is also an important part of the collaboration.
    </DetailsContent>
  </Details>
</Card>

In addition to these four values, we emphasise that Designsystemet should be easy to adopt for both developers and designers. It should be easy to navigate, understand what a component does, and know when to use it. Components should be adaptable and flexible enough to act as building blocks in more complex solutions. The technical setup should be predictable and straightforward to work with. If there are known limitations or challenges related to a component, these should be clearly documented.

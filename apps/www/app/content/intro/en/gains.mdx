Designsystemet has been assessed as a national shared solution through a [socio-economic analysis](/en/intro/cba) carried out by Agenda Kaupang on behalf of Digdir in 2025. The analysis shows that organisations adopting Designsystemet can achieve significant benefits, particularly in the form of time savings in design and development work, as well as improved quality in digital services.

The benefits can be realised while the organisation maintains its own visual identity and distinctiveness, whether Designsystemet is used directly in solutions or as a foundation for an organisation’s own design system.

## Freed-up time and increased efficiency
The largest monetised benefit is reduced time spent on design and development. How much you can save depends on how many solutions you develop, and whether you use Designsystemet directly in your solutions or build your own design system on top with additional components.

Based on insights from the socio-economic analysis, we assume an estimated time saving of **25%** for design and frontend work when Designsystemet is used directly in solutions, and **35%** when the organisation builds its own design system on top. The higher saving reflects increased reuse of components and patterns.

The calculator provides a simplified estimate and is based on **1,695 hours per full-time equivalent (FTE)**. Actual benefits will vary depending on the organisation, its maturity, and how Designsystemet is adopted.

For organisations that build their own design systems based on Designsystemet, the efficiency gains are primarily based on interviews. The analysis assumes an **80% efficiency gain** during the establishment phase. Several organisations have reported that building a design system on top of Designsystemet is significantly faster, in some cases **90–200% faster**.

The calculations are intended as decision support. For leaders, this provides a concrete basis for considering Designsystemet as a measure to increase efficiency, improve quality, and support more sustainable development of digital services.

## Other benefits
In addition to freed-up time, the analysis highlights several important non-monetised benefits, such as improved regulatory compliance and more accessible services for citizens.

  **Improved fulfilment of rights and obligations**

  When digital solutions become more accessible and easier to understand, this can contribute to improved fulfilment of rights and obligations for digitally vulnerable users. It can make it easier for more people to access information and services needed to exercise their rights and meet their obligations towards the public sector.

  **Improved regulatory compliance**

  Designsystemet contributes to improved compliance with accessibility regulations (WCAG) and plain language requirements. Ready-made components and shared guidelines make it easier to make correct choices in both design and development, reducing the risk of errors. The analysis estimates that a good design system can contribute to increased compliance with **30–50%** of WCAG requirements.

  **Time saved for citizens** 

  When citizens encounter recognisable interaction patterns and solutions that comply with accessibility and plain language requirements, they spend less time orienting themselves and completing tasks. They do not need to relearn new solutions for each service, reducing both time spent and cognitive load.

Using a config file with the CLI gives you more control over your colours and makes it easier to update and maintain them.

## Getting Started

The config file can be named whatever you want, but if you use `designsystemet.config.json`, we will find it automatically when you run commands in the same folder.
You can place it anywhere in your project.

If you've placed your file in a different location or with a different name, you can use `--config <path>` in CLI commands.

```json
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/@digdir/designsystemet/dist/config.schema.json",
  "themes": {
    "my-theme": {
      "colors": {
        "main": { "primary": "#0062BA" },
        "neutral": "#1E2B3C",
        "support": { "extra1": "#F45F63" }
      },
      "borderRadius": 4,
      "typography": {
        "fontFamily": "Inter"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Above, we have defined a theme called `my-theme` with some colours and border radius.
Note that `neutral` is defined as a string, while `main` and `support` are objects.
This is because `neutral` only has one colour, while `main` and `support` have multiple.

## Structure

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| $schema | String | No | Path to JSON schema for validation. Recommended: `node_modules/@digdir/designsystemet/dist/config.schema.json`. |
| themes | Object | Yes | Contains all themes you want to define. Each key is the name of the theme. |
| outDir | String | Yes | The folder where design tokens should be saved. |
| clean | Boolean | No | Delete the output directory before creating tokens. Useful for removing deprecated files. |

### Themes

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| "themeName" | Object | Yes | The theme you want to define. |

You can have multiple themes, and each theme can have its own colours, border radius, typography, and overrides.

### Theme

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| colors | Object | Yes | Contains all colours for the theme. |
| borderRadius | Number | No | Base border radius for the theme. |

| overrides | Object | No | Contains overrides for colours and severity colours. |

### Typography
| Name | Type | Required | Description |

<Alert data-color="info">

### Colors
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| main | Object | Yes | Main colours for the theme. |
| neutral | String | Yes | Neutral colour for the theme. |
| support | Object | No | Support colours for the theme. Defaults to empty object. |

The object for main and support contains colours, where the name is the colour's name and the value is a hex code.

```json
{
  "main": {
    "primary": "#0062BA",
    "accent": "#1E98F5"
  },
  "neutral": "#1E2B3C"
}
```

### Overrides
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| colors | Object | No | Contains overrides for individual colour tokens |
| severity | Object | No | Contains overrides for severity colours |
| linkVisited | Object | No | Contains overrides for visited link colour |

#### overrides.colors
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| "colorName" | Object | No | Overrides for a specific colour |

The `colors` override allows you to customise specific semantic colour tokens for any colour defined in your theme.

Each key in the `colors` object should match a colour name from your colours (both `main` and `support` colours), or one of the severity colours (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`).

For each colour, you can override individual semantic tokens like `background-default`, `border-subtle`, `text-default`, etc.
Each token override has a `light` and/or `dark` value that points to a hex code.

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "colors": {
      "primary": {
        "background-default": {
          "light": "#ff0000",
          "dark": "#000fff"
        },
        "text-subtle": {
          "light": "#333333",
          "dark": "#cccccc"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Colour names

#### overrides.severity

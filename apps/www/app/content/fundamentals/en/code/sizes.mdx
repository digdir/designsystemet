HTML data attributes are used to define the size of a component. Components can use all available sizes.

Our `size` variables (`--ds-size-*`) change based on the local font size (formula based on `em`). You can easily change this by setting `data-size` for our recommended sizes, or define your own sizes by setting `font-size` in CSS.

## `data-size`

This data attribute is used to change sizes on all components beneath it.
All components can be in the sizes `sm`, `md` or `lg`. By default, `md` will be used.

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <!-- Content here will have MD sizes -->
  </div>

  <div data-size="sm">
    <!-- Content here will have SM sizes -->
  </div>
</body>
```

Some components support more sizes, such as `xs` and `xl`. These sizes will be specified in the component's documentation,
and it is recommended to use the sizes that are specified.

## How components are affected

We divide components into 2 groups for sizes:

- Explicit
- Cascading

### Explicit

Components that will not follow the size of the parent. These components must have `data-size` set directly on them.

These are components like:
- `Heading`

### Cascading

This group contains the rest of the components, and will inherit size from the nearest parent with `data-size` set.

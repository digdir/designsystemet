Designsystemet is designed to be used with your own visual identity, including colours and other preferences. With the [Designsystemet Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no), you can set up your theme and generate Design Tokens that can be used both in design tools and in code. Design Tokens ensure that both design and code use the same values.

<Alert data-color="info">
We recommend that both a developer and a designer take part in the process when setting up your theme.
</Alert>

## How to get started:

1. Use [Designsystemets Themebuilder](https://theme.designsystemet.no) to set up your theme and get started, or use the example below as a starting point. 
 - The config file must be saved as a `json` file, we recommend e.g. `designsystemet.config.json` or `<your-organization>.config.json`.

```json
{
  "outDir": "./design-tokens",
  "clean": true,
  "themes": {
    "theme": {
      "colors": {
        "main": { "primary": "#0062BA" },
        "neutral": "#1E2B3C",
        "support": { "extra1": "#F45F63" }
      },
      "borderRadius": 4
    }
  }
}
```
2. Find a Git repository where you can store your Design Tokens. Place the `designsystemet.config.json` file in the root of the repository.

3. Clone the repository locally to your machine, open a terminal, and navigate to the folder containing the repository.

4. Make sure you have Node.js installed, version 20 or higher.

5. Run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
npx @digdir/designsystemet@latest tokens create --config designsystemet.config.json
```
This will generate Design Tokens based on the configuration file and save them in a folder called `design-tokens`. Push the changes to your repository.

6. Fetch the component library from [Figma Community (figma.com)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1322138390374166141/designsystemet-core-ui-kit) (Click “Open in Figma”) into your organisation that has at least a Pro licence. Note that this will be a copy of the component library without any connection to the main file.

7. Install the plugin [Tokens Studio (figma.com)](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens)). This plugin enables synchronisation between Figma and code. You do *not* need a Pro licence.

  - In the plugin, set up the connection to your Git repository. See Tokens Studio’s guide “[Sync your Design Tokens with code (tokens.studio)](https://docs.tokens.studio/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-overview)” which explains how to do this for different Git providers.
  - Remember to set the “Token storage location” to `design-tokens` (or whatever you have named your Design Tokens folder).

<Alert data-color="info">
We recommend *not* pushing changes to Design Tokens from Tokens Studio, as this may cause you to lose your overrides when updating.
</Alert>

8. Go to the [Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no) and generate colour scales based on your brand colours. Click “Apply theme”. Copy the configuration file and paste it into the `designsystemet.config.json` file in your repository. Run the command below and push the changes.


```bash
npx @digdir/designsystemet@latest tokens create --config designsystemet.config.json
```

**Remember to run this command every time you make changes to the configuration file.**

9. In Tokens Studio, select the “Pull” icon to fetch the new tokens into Figma.

<Image
  src='/img/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme/tokens-studio-pull-button.png'
  alt='Screenshot of Tokens Studio showing where to find the pull button'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

Select `Styles & variables` and `Export styles & variables to Figma`.

<Image
  src='/img/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme/tokens-export.png'
  alt='Screenshot of Tokens Studio showing where to find the export button'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

Make sure you have these settings before clicking `Confirm`:

<Image
  src='/img/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme/tokens-export-options.png'
  alt='Screenshot of Tokens Studio showing which settings to use when exporting tokens to Figma'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

Select `Themes`, `Select All`, and `Export to Figma`:

<Image
  src='/img/fundamentals/themebuilder/own-theme/tokens-export-themes-select.png'
  alt='Screenshot of Tokens Studio showing that you must select Themes and then Select All'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

You should now see all components using your brand colours in Figma. Note: If you changed the names of the colours in the Theme Builder, you must go into Figma Variables and manually delete the old colours.

**Note: Token Studio does not delete existing modes during export. After export, check Theme, Main color, and Support color, and remove any default themes that may still remain from the community file.**

If you want additional themes, you can generate a new theme in the Theme Builder and update the configuration file in your repository. Run the command again to generate new Design Tokens, push the changes, and use the “Pull” button in Tokens Studio to fetch the new themes into Figma.


```json
{
  "outDir": "./design-tokens",
  "clean": true,
  "themes": {
    "theme-one": {
      "colors": {
        "main": { "primary": "#0062BA" },
        "neutral": "#1E2B3C",
        "support": { "extra1": "#F45F63" }
      },
      "borderRadius": 4
    },
    "theme-two": {
      "colors": {
        "main": { "primary": "#0062BA" },
        "neutral": "#1E2B3C",
        "support": { "extra1": "#F45F63" }
      },
      "borderRadius": 4
    }
  }
}
```

<Alert data-color="info">
When the Design Tokens are updated in code, you can easily fetch the new values into Figma by using the “Pull” button in Tokens Studio again.
</Alert>


10. To generate CSS from your theme, run the following command:

```bash
npx @digdir/designsystemet@latest tokens build --config designsystemet.config.json
```

Remember that this must also be done whenever the tokens are updated.

These are the values we want Designsystemet to be built on:

## Quality
The Designsystemet should maintain high quality and make it efficient to create digital products with good quality. By quality, we mean both providing a good user experience and having a solid technical foundation. All components must meet legal requirements, such as accessibility. But the requirements are only a minimum. We want to go further by creating [accessible](/no/fundamentals/introduction/accessibility) solutions that work as well as possible for everyone. When it works for people with disabilities, the experience becomes better for all users. 

## Coherence
The goal of the Designsystemet is to contribute to coherent and consistent user experiences across solutions and organisations. Shared building blocks and recognisable patterns create predictability and more intuitive solutions, and can also help reduce digital exclusion. The Designsystemet should allow for different visual profiles, while ensuring that components and interaction patterns behave consistently on screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Collaboration and openness
The Designsystemet is based on a philosophy of collaboration, and it should be developed in cooperation between public and private actors. It should be easy for everyone to take ownership of the Designsystemet and get involved with contributions and feedback. There should be a simple path to change if contributions lead to better solutions. By working openly we avoid unnecessary duplication of work and build solutions that more people can reuse. In this way, we contribute to a more sustainable development of digital services.

## Designer and developer experience
It should be easy for designers and developers to start using the Designsystemet. It should be simple to navigate, understand what a component does, and know when it should be used. The components should be adaptable and flexible enough to serve as building blocks that can be combined into more complex solutions for specific needs. The technical solution should be straightforward and predictable to navigate. If there are challenges related to a component, these should be made visible and documented.

## Trust
The Designsystemet should handle challenges and changes in a safe and predictable way so that it earns a high level of trust among its users. Components should function reliably and behave as expected. Users should be confident that the Designsystemet is well maintained and updated in line with new requirements and emerging needs. We also aim for mutual trust, where trust in contributors is equally important.

Designsystemet is more than just a set of components and guidelines. It is a collaborative space where we align on what the user experience across the public sector should be – and continuously improve it together. Most importantly, it provides an open forum for discussing accessibility, rather than having these discussions happen in isolation within each organisation.

Through an open source community, Designsystemet has a broad range of users who influence the solution through feedback, contributions, and code. We also realised there was a need for closer involvement from more organisations to ensure that Designsystemet meets shared needs. This is why we now have a cross-agency core team working on daily development. We hold planning meetings, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and working sessions around various challenges. Developers and designers collaborate closely. We maintain an open [GitHub repo](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet), [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3), and [discussion threads](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions), and aim to be as transparent as possible.

The development team includes designers and developers from The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir), the Brønnøysund Register Centre, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the Directorate for Education and Training, and KS Digital. We also have a wide network of contributors from other organisations who help shape Designsystemet.

We want to strengthen this collaboration even further. Could it be an opportunity for your organisation to take part in this development team? We’d love to hear from you. [Get in touch via email](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no).

## Open demos

Every month, we host open demos for anyone interested in Designsystemet. We showcase what the team has worked on since the last session and share what’s coming up. These demos are an important space for gathering input and feedback so we can shape the way forward together.

[Contact us for an invitation to the demo](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no)

## Communication in Slack

To succeed with a shared design system, we need a shared space for communication and discussion across organisations. That’s why we’ve set up an open Slack workspace for everyone interested in Designsystemet – whether you are actively using it, considering adopting it, or simply curious.

When planning major changes or tackling challenges, we post them in Slack to gather feedback and input. The Slack channel is also a space for asking questions, sharing experiences, and discussing everything from practical challenges to overarching principles. Designers, developers, product owners, and other stakeholders can exchange ideas, give feedback, and learn from one another.

We’re enthusiastic about design systems in general and hope the Slack workspace will foster knowledge-sharing and a strong professional community across organisations. Together, we develop both Designsystemet and the competence around it.

[Join Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack) and get involved – every contribution counts, no matter the size. We’re happy to receive all your questions, ideas, and feedback!


## Pattern collaboration

In addition to the development team, we also have a cross-agency initiative to establish shared patterns across public services. This collaboration is important for creating a more holistic and consistent user experience. The design system teams from Digdir, NAV, the Norwegian Tax Administration, the Brønnøysund Register Centre, the City of Oslo, the Norwegian Police, and Entur are among those taking part in this effort.

We gather insights from our own organisations, review them, identify inconsistencies, and reach a common approach through regular working sessions. This work results in articles and recommendations on the [Patterns page](https://www.designsystemet.no/en/patterns).

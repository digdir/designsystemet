## What is the Design System?
The Design System is a shared toolbox of basic UI components, guidelines, and patterns. The Design System aims to contribute to cohesive user experiences and efficient product development.

The Design System is a collective good through open source, and can be used by anyone to the extent they wish.

### Why a _shared_ design system?
There are many reasons to have a shared design system, here are two of the most important.

1. **Cohesive services across organizations** \
By collaborating on a shared design system, we can better ensure cohesive, accessible, and recognizable user experiences across agencies. The Norwegian government aims to ensure that _"public digital services should have a user-friendly and recognizable design across different agencies so that citizens with low digital competence can use the service"_. <sup>1</sup>

2. **Less duplicate work** \
Instead of creating the same basic components over and over again, we can create them properly once and ensure good quality by maintaining accessibility requirements and testing. Best of all - we then have only one place to maintain them when new technologies, standards, requirements, and needs emerge. This means optimized resource use in the public sector and reduced development costs. It also means more time to solve more important problems for our users.

## How to use the Design System?

The Design System should be used as a foundation, where you have your own visual profile on top. By using basic building blocks from the Design System, you can build more complex components that meet your specific needs.

## What does the Design System consist of?

The Design System consists of several building blocks and tools. You can use what you need, to the extent you wish.

- **Design Tokens** \
  [Design Tokens](/en/fundamentals/designelements/design-tokens) are variables that control colors, typography, sizes, spacing, and shapes. The variables are set up to be theme-based, meaning they are based on your brand with the colors and preferences you choose in the Theme Builder. The [color system](/en/fundamentals/for-designers/colors) ensures good contrast between text and background colors, regardless of your profile colors. The token structure supports having both multiple themes and multiple "modes" (dark-mode, light-mode, contrast-mode, etc.). Design Tokens also ensure that we work with the same values in design and code. Design tokens are the magic!

- **UI Components** \
  The Design System contains the most basic UI components that provide value to share across organizations. The UI components are available in libraries for [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet), [CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet-css), and [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet-react). We document how the components should be used and update the guidelines as we gain more insights.

- **Theme Builder** \
[The Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no/) makes it easy to use the Design System in your own organization with your own brand colors and preferences. After customizing the theme, you copy a code snippet and paste it into the terminal or Figma. In just a few minutes, you have all the components in Figma and code with your own design.

- **Command Line Tool (CLI)** \
The Design System's [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet) helps with setting up new projects, generating basic structures, configuring themes, necessary dependencies, and configuration.

- **Patterns and Best Practices** \
  The Design System is a collaboration arena for developing recognizable [patterns](/en/patterns) and shared [recommendations](/good-practice). By patterns, we mean, for example, where key elements should be placed in the interface, and how navigation, error messages, and other recurring user tasks should behave. We can collaborate on patterns even if we don't use the same technical components or design elements.

- **Blog** \
  In the blog, we can communicate about new updates and share stories. We hope more people will use the blog to write about how they have implemented the Design System.

- **Community** \
The Design System aims to facilitate broad knowledge sharing around design systems and everything related. You can join us on [Slack](http://designsystemet.no/slack) and on [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester).

## Who can use and contribute to the Design System?

Anyone who creates digital solutions can use the Design System. It is open source, and we appreciate your contributions to make the Design System better. [Let us know](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new/choose) if you find an error or want to suggest an improvement. You can ask questions in the Slack channel [#Designsystemet](https://designsystemet.no/slack), where we help each other.

### How can you contribute?

We don't have a specific approach you must follow to contribute, but please contact us on [Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack) when you have a need, and we can assess the need together.

## Who uses the Design System today?

The Design System is used in [Altinn Studio](https://altinn.studio/), where 70 different agencies develop their services. If you use Altinn Studio to develop services, you automatically use components from the Design System.

Several public organizations have also implemented the Design System in their own services.

## How do we collaborate across organizations?
Once a month, we have a "Demo and Collaboration Forum" that is open to all stakeholders. Here we share what we have worked on since the last meeting. [Contact us](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no) if you would like to receive a meeting invitation.

The development team currently consists mainly of the design system team at Digdir, along with designers and developers from Brønnøysund Register Centre, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, and KS Digital. We hope the development team will become an even more cross-agency team. Would your organization like to be more closely involved in the collaboration? Send us an email at:
[designsystem@digdir.no](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no)

In addition, we have a [pattern collaboration](/en/patterns), where Digdir, Nav, Norwegian Tax Administration, Oslo Municipality, Entur, Norwegian Police, and Brønnøysund Register Centre, among others, participate in working groups to establish common patterns across organizations.

Being open and transparent is an important value for us.

We share everything we do openly:

- [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/1)
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/30)

What do you do when there's a new version of the [Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet)?

Figma currently [does not support retrieving changes from a Community file](https://forum.figma.com/t/need-a-way-to-get-latest-updates-or-subscribe-to-changes-from-a-published-community-file/32571). 

The Figma file you have in your organization is a copy without a connection to the main file. You can choose to make changes to this and adapt it to your organization before publishing it to the rest of the organization. 

## Updates from the Community file

When changes are published to the Community file, you must decide **if** and **when** you want to update your own version. All changes are documented in a public changelog:

[View the changelog for a full overview of changes](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/wiki/Figma-Community-Changelog)

Use the changelog as a basis for deciding which updates are relevant to your team.

### New components

New components can be copied directly into your file.

After copying, you must:
- connect the components to the correct variables in your own library  
- verify that instances and behavior work as expected  

This ensures that the components function correctly together with the rest of your library.

### Updates to existing components

For updates to existing components — including bug fixes and minor adjustments — we provide dedicated guides that describe the recommended approach for applying the changes in your file.

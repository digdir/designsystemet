When working with components in Figma, you may often need to customise the content without breaking the connection to the main component. Many solve this by *detaching* the component, but that means you lose the benefits of inheriting changes and improvements from the library.  

With **slots**, you can instead keep the connection while adding your own content. Slots act as open areas within a component where you can place other components. If you need more complex compositions of content and different components, you can combine them into a separate component and then insert that component into the slot.  

Several of our components are built with slots, allowing you to customise what content to place inside them. This applies to `Card`, `Details`, and `Dialog`.  

## Why use slots?
- **Keeps the connection to the library.** You do not need to update manually when the main component changes.  
- **More flexible use.** You can insert content that varies from case to case, without altering the component itself.  
- **Consistency and control.** The structure and style come from Desigsystemet, while you have the freedom to add your own content.  

## How does it work in practice?
Let’s take an example with a `Dialog` component. A `Dialog` can have different content depending on the need – everything from a simple text message to more complex user interfaces.

1. Insert the `Dialog` from the library.  
2. Instead of *detaching*, use the slot area that is available inside the component.  
3. Add the content you need, for example, a table or a list.  
4. If the content consists of several elements, you can create a new component of that content and place it inside the slot.

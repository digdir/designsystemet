## Choose your own icon set

With Designsystemet, you choose which icon set to use. Some use Nav’s icon set, while others choose alternatives that better match their visual profile. It’s entirely up to you and what works best for your organization.  

## Nav’s icon set

Nav has created a robust [set of icons (nav.no)](https://aksel.nav.no/ikoner) (900+) that is open for both use and contributions. We believe that having consistent meaning for icons across the public sector provides only benefits.  

The icons support resizing and color adjustments, and are available in both stroke and fill variants.  

Here you can find the icon overview: [aksel.nav.no/ikoner](https://aksel.nav.no/ikoner)<br/>
Here you can download the icon package: [cdn.nav.no/aksel/icons](https://cdn.nav.no/aksel/icons/zip/aksel-icons.zip)<br/>
Here you can find the NPM package: [@navikt/aksel-icons (npmjs.com)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@navikt/aksel-icons)<br/>
Here you can find the icons in Figma: [Core Icons 3 (figma.com)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1214869602572392330/Core-Icons-3)<br/>

### Accessibility

The icons should work for all users, regardless of their situation. Read more about [how to ensure accessibility (nav.no)](https://aksel.nav.no/god-praksis/artikler/tilgjengelig-ikonbruk) when using icons and which aria attributes you should use.


### How to contribute

Do you have suggestions for new icons or improvements?  
[Submit your request here (github.com)](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/ikonforesp%C3%B8rsler).  
Together with NAV, we will evaluate whether the icon should be added to Nav’s library.  

If there are many recurring needs that don’t fit into that library, we may consider offering an additional package from Designsystemet.  

Remember, you can always create your own icons for your own needs in your own solution, that way you don’t have to wait for them to become part of a shared package. If you create icons to be used alongside Nav’s icon set, it’s recommended to follow their [guidelines (github.com)](https://github.com/navikt/aksel/blob/main/%40navikt/aksel-icons/CONTRIBUTING.md) for consistency.

When we visit a website or use an app, we tend to scan the content. We look for something that catches our attention, such as a clue about what’s important, what we need to do, or whether a paragraph contains the answer to our question.

This reading style must be taken into account when creating content. We also need to consider the reading abilities of our users. While most adults in Norway have strong reading skills, many find the language used in public digital services hard to understand. This may be due to not having Norwegian as a first language, cognitive challenges, or other reasons for having weak reading skills. Even users with strong reading abilities can struggle when the language includes unfamiliar words, complex concepts, or abstract topics.

Clear structure, plain language, and familiar words make it easier for everyone to skim and understand the content. This is especially important for users with weaker reading skills, but it benefits all users.

## How to write texts that are easy to skim read

1. **Use bullet points for lists**

   - Maximum one sentence per point, preferably just a few words.

2. **Use short words**

   - Choose simple and short words instead of formal or long words.
   - Use the words that users use.
   - Avoid jargon, outdated words, and trendy terms.

3. **Avoid long sentences**

   - One point in each sentence.
   - Avoid more than 15 words in a sentence.

4. **One topic in each paragraph**

   - Have a maximum of 3-4 sentences per paragraph.

5. **Create meaningful headings and subheadings**

Headings and subheadings should reflect the content of the paragraph. They should preferably be a complete sentence.

- Headings function as signposts in the text and make it easier to scan and read.
- Subheadings should connect narratively so that users understand the most important points by just reading them.
- Put the most important words first.

6. **Don't use capital letters, italics, and bold text**

7. **Write in plain language**

At the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, we are two content designers supporting multiple products and teams. To raise awareness of language, content design, and microcopy, we offer courses on various topics related to creating great content.

We've also begun standardizing certain language elements across our services. This helps product teams avoid uncertainty about what to write on a button or in a component.

This article offers recommendations for commonly used labels on buttons and navigation elements. We introduced these at the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency before the summer, and the response has been positive. People have been asking for this, and we hope the recommendations will be helpful to others as well.

### How did we approach this?

We researched and compared terminology used by other organizations, where possible. We also reviewed definitions in both Norwegian and English. With these recommendations, we hope buttons and navigation elements can become more consistent across products and services.

We welcome suggestions for other terms that could be useful to align on. This way, those who create public digital services can offer users consistent content elements from one place to another, just like they already benefit from consistent components.

### These are the concepts we have created recommendations for

| Word | We recommend |
|---|---|
| Delete/Remove | We recommend using "Delete" as the button name everywhere. This is to avoid having two terms for the same action. If we need to clarify that something "will be permanently gone," we can either provide a warning or write "Delete permanently" on the button. We have decided not to use "Remove." We don't need two terms for the same action. |
| Next/Previous | We recommend "Next" and "Previous" on buttons in English. |
| Continue/Go back<br />Go to (for example inbox)<br />To (inbox) | Can be used for breadcrumbs/nav links.<br />This way we distinguish between the next step in the flow and the action of "browsing through a lot of information." |
| Change/Edit | We recommend "Change." It's short and familiar to everyone. |
| Close | We recommend "Close" as the text for closing modals, if something more than an x-symbol/icon is needed. |
| Show/Hide | We recommend "Show" and "Hide" as text in, for example, accordions/dropdowns. Many just use the chevron symbol (^) or down and up arrows.<br />In lists with a lot of text, where parts of the introduction are shown, we can consider "Show more" and "Show less." Most relevant on websites. |

### Provide context for screen readers

In some contexts, we should provide context to clarify what is being deleted, closed, or changed. For example, "Delete application," "Close product overview," "Change profile picture." When only verbs are shown without context, the missing information should be included in the `aria-label` to ensure accessibility for screen reader users.

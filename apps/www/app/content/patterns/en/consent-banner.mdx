A consent banner should give users genuine control over their own data. At the same time, it must be clear, understandable and accessible to everyone. Today, this is handled differently across public services, both in terms of language, design, equal presentation of choices and technical implementation.

A shared pattern for consent banners can contribute to:

- A more consistent and recognisable user experience  
- Equal presentation of choices, without manipulative design  
- Improved accessibility and inclusive design  
- Clearer distinction between necessary and optional technologies  
- A shared understanding of recommended interaction and behaviour

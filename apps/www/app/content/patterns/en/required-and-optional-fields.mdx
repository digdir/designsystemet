There are several ways to mark required fields that [meet the requirements for labelling (uutilsynet.no)](https://www.uutilsynet.no/veiledning/skjema/38#ledetekster_og_instruksjoner). Different contexts may require different types of labelling, but by keeping this as consistent as possible across our services, it becomes easier for users to understand and recognise the pattern.

A general guideline is to avoid asking for information we do not need, and therefore also to avoid optional fields. Make sure there are not too many questions on the same page. Content on the same page should share the same theme or include questions that are related to each other.

Below we describe two common scenarios for labelling form fields.

1. [When you only have required fields](#1-when-you-only-have-required-fields)
2. [When you have a combination of required and optional fields](#2-when-you-have-a-combination-of-required-and-optional-fields)

## 1. When you only have required fields

If all fields on a page must be completed, you can clearly inform users at the top that _all fields must be completed_. In this case, you do not need to label each individual field. If there is only one field, this can be made clear through the question or description.

- For example, use a yellow tag as shown in the example below, or make it clear in the introductory text.
- Avoid the terms _“Required”_ and _“Mandatory”_.

  <Image
    src='/img/obligatorisk-eks2.png'
    alt='Screenshot of a form with several questions per page.'
    boxShadow={false}
  />

## 2. When you have a combination of required and optional fields

As a general rule, we should only ask users for information we absolutely need and avoid optional fields. However, there will be situations where this cannot be avoided. If you _must_ include optional fields in addition to required ones, you should label all fields individually. In that case, there is no need to add information at the top.

- Clearly inform users with “Must be completed” or “Optional” after each question or label.
- Avoid the terms _“Required”_ and _“Mandatory”_.
- For example, use a yellow tag for “Must be completed” and a blue one for “Optional”.
- Do not use an asterisk to mark fields that must be completed.

<Image
  src='/img/obligatorisk-eks3.png'
  alt='Screenshot of a form with several questions per page, both required and optional.'
  boxShadow={false}
/>

description: How can we create a more predictable and inclusive experience by standardizing button placement and order?
date: 2025-01-29

Different placements and orders of buttons, especially navigation buttons, can create unnecessary confusion for users. This applies in forms, step-by-step processes, dialogs, and popovers, where buttons often guide the user forward or complete an action. Shared patterns for button order and placement can contribute to a more predictable and inclusive experience.

A cross-agency working group will address this in the fall of 2025 to establish common guidelines and recommendations. We welcome input from anyone with relevant experience, insights, or user testing related to this topic. Please share your contributions in the related [discussion thread about button placement at github.com](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/1671).

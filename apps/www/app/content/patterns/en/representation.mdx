When people sign in to public digital services, they are not always acting on their own behalf. Many perform tasks on behalf of others, perhaps as part of their job, or in the role of guardian, parent, or board chair. If it is not clear who they are acting on behalf of, or which organisation they represent, it can lead to mistakes, delays, or other unintended consequences.

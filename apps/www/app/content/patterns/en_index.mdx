If we can establish common patterns, it becomes easier for a user who has done something in one place to recognize and understand how to do it elsewhere. This way, we can help include more people digitally. It is also one of the measures in the "[Action Plan for Increased Inclusion in a Digital Society, measure 26](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/handlingsplan-for-auka-inkludering-i-eit-digitalt-samfunn/id2984233/)", which states that we should work towards more similar interaction patterns across services.

Common patterns can, for example, contribute to:

- Interaction and behavior of elements becoming recognizable across services.
- Placement of key elements meeting user expectations.
- Recurring user tasks being experienced as familiar.

In the report "[Digital throughout life with better user experience](https://www.digdir.no/sammenhengende-tjenester/digital-hele-livet-med-bedre-brukeropplevelse/4405)", several [concrete usability problems](https://github.com/digdir/innsiktsbibliotek/issues/3) have been identified that can be improved if we collaborate on establishing similar patterns across public services. We can collaborate on patterns even if we don't use the same technical components or design elements.

To establish shared patterns across organisations, we have created a cross-agency pattern collaboration. You can read more about this in the [Collaboration model](/en/intro/collaboration#3-tverretatlig-mønster-samarbeid).

We gather insights from our respective organisations, review them together, identify differences, and agree on a shared approach through regular working sessions. Anyone can influence the work through open discussions in [Slack](https://www.designsystemet.no/slack) and [GitHub](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester). If you would like to be more closely involved, there is also room for additional participants in the working groups. [Get in touch by email](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no).

## Planned patterns

Patterns that require cross-agency collaboration are documented in [this GitHub overview](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/patterns-for-public-services?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Patterns+for+public+services%22+sort%3Atop).

The main group for the pattern collaboration prioritises which patterns to work on and initiates working groups as needed. If you have suggestions for additional patterns, you are welcome to [start a new discussion thread](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/new?category=samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester).

We also appreciate any insights shared in the topic threads for each pattern.

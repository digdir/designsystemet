A react hook to synchronize CSS animations across multiple elements.

<Story story="Preview" />

You pass in the name of the animation you want to synchronize.
The hook returns a `ref`, which you pass to your element.
The animation on your element will be synchronized to the first animation with the same name on the page.

## Bruk

```tsx
const SyncedBox = () => {
  const ref = useSynchronizedAnimation<HTMLDivElement>('spin');

  return <div ref={ref} />;
};
```

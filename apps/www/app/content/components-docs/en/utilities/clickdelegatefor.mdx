## Usage

You add `data-clickdelegatefor` to an element, and set the value to the id of the element you want to delegate the click to.

```html
<div class="ds-card" data-clickdelegatefor="target">
  <a id="target" href="https://example.com" rel="noopener">Go to example.com</a>
  <span>Clicking this card will open example in a new tab</span>
</div>
```

### When should I use `data-clickdelegatefor`?
Use `data-clickdelegatefor` when you have an element that cannot be focused, but you want it to be clickable and perform an action. This is especially useful for elements like `<div>`, `<span>`, or other non-interactive elements that you want to make interactive without changing their semantic meaning.

In the example above, we make a card (`<div>`) clickable by delegating the click to a link (`<a>`). This means that screen reader users get standard focus on the link, but the entire card will be clickable, improving the user experience without compromising accessibility.

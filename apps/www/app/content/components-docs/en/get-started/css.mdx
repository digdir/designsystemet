### Layers

We use [css layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) to get the lowest possible specificity in our css.
This means that you can easily override it with your own styling.

All our layers are under the layer group `ds`.

For example, if you have a css reset, this will override parts of what we have done. We recommend putting this in a layer and sorting this first.
You do this by first putting your reset in a layer, and then sorting this layer first:

```css
@layer my-reset, ds;
```

### Data attributes

We offer several data attributes that can be used to change the theme of the components.

#### `data-color-scheme`

Used to change the color mode of the components. Possible values are `light`, `dark` and `auto`.

If `auto` is selected, the color mode will change based on the user's preferences using
[prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

You can read more about this at "[Colors in code](/en/fundamentals/code/colors)".

#### `data-typography`

Used to change the typography of the components. Possible values ​​are `primary` and `secondary`.

A common use for this attribute is when you want a monospace font on tables.

Which typography is associated with `primary` or `secondary` must be defined in the team, using [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/)
(with the Designsystemet design-tokens) or [Theme Builder](https://theme.designsystemet.no/en).

If you are going to use this attribute, you must remember to define `font-family` to use the `--ds-font-family` CSS variable.

This can be solved by, for example, using [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) in CSS.

```html
<style>
[data-typography='secondary'] {
  font-family: var(--ds-font-family), monospace;
}
</style>
<table data-typography='secondary'>
…
</table>
```

### Helper classes

We use some helper classes that can be used more generally across components.

#### `ds-sr-only`
Visually hides an element while still being accessible to screen readers.

#### `ds-print-preserve`
Preserves appearance, including background color, in print.

#### `ds-focus` / `ds-focus--inset`
Adds the design system focus ring around the element _when it gains focus with keyboard navigation_ (`:focus-visible`).

#### `ds-focus--visible` / `ds-focus--visible--inset`
Static "always-on" classes that add the design system focus ring around the element. <span className='ds-focus--visible'>Example.</span>

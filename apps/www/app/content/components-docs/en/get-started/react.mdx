Follow these steps to get started with React components.

## 1. Install the packages

```sh
npm in @digdir/designsystemet-react @digdir/designsystemet-theme @digdir/designsystemet-css @digdir/designsystemet-types
```

### Typescript

If you are using Typescript, make sure you have typescript >= 3.8 in `devDependencies`:

```sh
npm in typescript --save-dev
```

## 2. Font

You are free to use any font family with the components.

The components are designed and developed with the [Inter font](https://github.com/rsms/inter), so variations may occur if you use a different font.

### Add the Inter font (optional)

Add the `<link>` tag in `<head>`, and set the `font-family` to `Inter` in your global css file.

`font-feature-settings` adds a tail to lowercase `L`s.

#### HTML

You can use this code to add the font:

```html
<link
rel="stylesheet"
href="https://altinncdn.no/fonts/inter/v4.1/inter.css"
integrity="sha384-OcHzc/By/OPw9uJREawUCjP2inbOGKtKb4A/I2iXxmknUfog2H8Adx71tWVZRscD"
crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

#### CSS

We strongly recommend that you add the following to your global css file.
`font-feature-settings` adds a tail to lowercase `L`s.

```css
body {
font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
font-feature-settings: 'cv05' 1; /* Enable lowercase l with tail */
}
```

If you choose to install the font in a different way, remember to include the font weights `400`, `500` and `600`.

## 3. Polyfill

The design system uses [popover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/popover) in some components. This api is classified as [Baseline: Newly available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) as of April 2024, when Firefox was the last browser to add it. In some cases, you may find that users are locked to older browser versions for various reasons, and then it may be appropriate to add a polyfill to ensure that `popover` works for everyone.

## 4. Use a React component

```jsx
import '@digdir/designsystemet-theme';
import '@digdir/designsystemet-css';

import { Button } from '@digdir/designsystemet-react';

<Button variant='secondary'>I'm a button!</Button>;
```

`@digdir/designsystemet-theme` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` must only be imported once in the application.

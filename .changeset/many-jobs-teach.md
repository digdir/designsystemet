"@digdir/designsystemet-css": patch
---

**Details:** content using `overflow: hidden` to prevent margin clipping
**Tabs:** adjusted to allow non-tab-button-elements inside `tablist`
**Table:**
- sorting icon never shrinks, even when using `Button` component (which is `display: flex`) as parent
- with `data-border` adjusts `border-radius` according to `border-width`

This article assumes that you have already defined the colors you will use with the help of the [Theme Builder](/en/fundamentals/for-designers/own-theme).

HTML data attributes are used to define the color of a component. The components can use all colors in the theme.

When setting the color on a component, there are two data attributes that can be used:
- `data-color-scheme` which changes the color mode
- `data-color` which changes the color

## `data-color-scheme`

This data attribute is used to switch between light, dark, or other color modes. Content that is a child of this data attribute 
will get the mode specified by the parent. By default, light mode will be used.

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <!-- Content here will have light color mode -->
  </div>

  <div data-color-scheme="dark">
    <!-- Content here will have dark color mode -->
  </div>
</body>
```

You can change `data-color-scheme` on all or parts of the page and switch between different color modes as often as you want. For example, the main page can be light, 
but with a dark footer. You can then set `data-color-scheme="dark"` on the footer.

`data-color-scheme` can be set to `light`, `dark`, or `auto`. `auto` will follow the user's system settings.

## `data-color`

This data attribute is used to change the color of a component. You can use all colors that exist in your theme.

```html
<div data-color="neutral">
  <!-- Content here will have neutral color -->
</div>
```

Some components can inherit color from the nearest parent element that has `data-color` defined. 
This means you don't need to use `data-color` on all components in a hierarchy if they should have the same color.

## How components are affected

We divide components into 3 groups for color:
- Explicit
- Neutral
- Cascading

### Explicit

Components used for validation or system alerts follow their own dedicated system colors and do not inherit color from the nearest parent with `data-color` set.
The dedicated system colors are `success`, `warning`, `danger`, and `info`. 

These are components like:
- `Alert`
- `ValidationMessage`
- `ErrorSummary`

### Neutral

These are components that should always be neutral and are not affected by inherited color or direct `data-color`. These are components like `Modal` and `Tooltip`.
They always use the `neutral` color.

### Cascading

This group contains the rest of the components and will inherit color from the nearest parent with `data-color` set. 

```html
<div data-color="neutral">
  <Chip>
    This Chip has neutral color.
  </Chip>
</div>

<Button data-color="neutral">
  I have neutral color.
</Button>

<div data-color="neutral">
  <Alert>
    I don't have neutral color.
  </Alert>
</div>
```

## Use `data-color-scheme` and `data-color` together

You can use `data-color-scheme` and `data-color` together to change both the color mode and color of components.

`data-color` sets variables that are reset by `data-color-scheme`. If you change the color mode, you must set `data-color` again.

```html
<div data-color="neutral">
  <!-- Content here will have neutral color -->
</div>

<div data-color="neutral" data-color-scheme="dark">
  <!-- Content here will have neutral color and dark color mode -->
</div>

<div data-color="neutral">
  <div data-color-scheme="dark">
    <!-- Content here will not have neutral color -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Brief summary

You change color with `data-color`, but this must be set again if you change the color mode with `data-color-scheme`. Some components inherit color from the nearest parent with `data-color` set.
